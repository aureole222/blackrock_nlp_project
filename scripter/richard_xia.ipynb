       " 'Tom Jacques (Greenwich Associates) provided a presentation summarising some of the initial findings from a pilot survey they conducted on conduct and fair outcomes in the FX market. Attendees discussed: (i) how fair outcomes can be defined and determined; (ii) the scope for broad-based independent surveys to provide information on conduct standards across the industry and how they can be used to improve standards and; (iii) the importance of client feedback and an understanding of what the key components of fair outcomes are from their perspective.

The Chair noted that additional FXJSC meetings had been scheduled to discuss the draft Code text and encouraged members to submit nominations for each of the FXJSC Code review working groups.',\n",
       " 'Grigoria Christodoulou (Bank of England) provided an update on the adherence workstream, noting that the adherence initiatives announced in May 2016, including establishing a link between adherence to the Code and membership of FXCs, were being refined and expanded upon. Furthermore, the Market Participants Group (MPG) had established a working group to consider a range of potential market based mechanisms to raise awareness of the Code and promote adherence to it as well as provide input into the overall adherence workstream.',\n",
       " 'Some attendees noted that ensuring sufficient outreach, both geographically and across different types of institutions, was vital to promulgate the Code and support widespread adoption. Guy Debelle agreed and noted that outreach to market associations and infrastructures were key to achieving this.

Attendees broadly agreed that there were a few factors that had contributed to the FX market’s resiliency around this event including: (i) the UK referendum was a known event and thus firms had undertaken extensive planning to reduce other risks such as by ensuring sufficient resourcing was in place across business lines and avoiding system developments around that time to ensure a more stable system environment; (ii) the steady flow of news as the results were published was likely to have reduced sudden and sharp market moves and; (iii) appropriate adjustments in risk appetite and active management of client expectations by banks. Attendees discussed how the FX market’s reaction and resiliency might differ in the case of an unexpected event.',\n",

WDSG agreed the publication timeline should be kept under review to ensure that key stakeholders would have capacity to engage with the consultation.',\n",
       " 'The Bank noted that the consultation paper would not be published before mid-May and that the consultation period would likely run for at least two months.',\n",

       " 'The Chair confirmed that the September MMC minutes had been published on the Bank’s website after agreement by written procedure following the last meeting.',\n",
       " 'The Chair drew the Committee’s attention to the Bank’s statement of 18 December 2019 regarding the misuse of an audio feed of certain of the Bank’s press conferences by a third party. He noted that the matter had been referred to the FCA, and that – if they had not already done so – firms should be identifying whether they had been using these services. They should also be assuring themselves whether any such use was consistent both with their statutory responsibilities and with their voluntary undertakings under the UK Money Markets and FX Global Codes.',\n",
       " 'The Chair noted that the Committee had previously agreed to establish three working groups to discuss key thematic developments in sterling money markets over the past three years. Those groups had covered, respectively: market participation and functioning; technology and innovation; and the impacts of regulatory reform. The purpose of forming these groups had been twofold: first, to inform the review of the UK Money Markets Code, which would take place in 2020; and, second, to identify future discussion themes for the MMC’s agendas. The groups had met 3-4 times each throughout the autumn and winter, and had included a large number of MMC members, as well as some members of the Code Sub-Committee, and Securities Lending Committee (SLC). The Chair thanked members for their contributions to each discussion group.',\n",
       " 'Members noted that a key cross-cutting theme across discussion in all of the groups had been the high and growing importance of tackling Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) in the money markets, echoing the regular agenda items on the MMC’s own agenda. The Groups suggested that D&I should now be positively encouraged within the Code, that the Code should not promote any gender bias, but should be sufficiently flexible to permit using new methods and ways of working. Rotating membership of the Committee may be one way to promote greater diversity. It was also suggested that the Code should be reviewed through a D&I prism to see if there were other provisions that might inadvertently militate against it. There was broad agreement throughout from members.',\n",
       " 'The first group covering the evolution in Market Participation and Functioning presented their findings. It was noted that, in the three years since the publication of the Code, total market volumes and activity had remained broadly unchanged. Within those totals, however, there had however been a noticeable shift in the composition of volumes in the unsecured overnight market, away from European banks, and towards non-European banks.',\n",
       " 'It was commented that a number of market participants were not yet well represented as signatories to the Code, including brokers, local authorities and corporates.',\n",
       " 'Central Counterparty Clearing Houses (CCPs) were playing an increasingly important infrastructural role in the market, but despite this, there was little specific mention of CCPs in the Code. The group therefore recommended that Code was updated to include specific reference to CCPs.',\n",
       " 'The group also presented findings on market transparency. Members noted the careful balance required between promoting the principles of transparency – which the working group felt was important for the Code to do – and the need to establish appropriate controls over confidentiality and information sharing. Members questioned whether greater focus was required on the former as part of the review. More practically, working group members flagged a desire for the Bank to make more of the Sterling Money Markets Data (SMMD) publicly available.',\n",
       " 'Working group members felt that feedback on the Code could usefully be sought from a somewhat wider group, including trade bodies and market participants not on the MMC, and those who had been unable to sign up to the Code. The Code should also be promoted to a wider audience.',\n",
       " 'Finally, several possible future agenda items for the Committee were proposed, including: a reflecting on the market impact of Structural Reform, and a discussion around the market impacts of the Bank’s facilities.',\n",
       " 'The discussion group which had investigated the impacts of technology and other innovations in the market over the past three year presented their findings. It noted that the proliferation of data being held in proprietary IT systems or in the Cloud was raising increasingly complex questions and challenges about where and how these data were stored and who owned them, including in the context of GDPR. Working group members felt the Code should address the need for firms to have a policy on storing and using market data. This material should not be overly prescriptive – but the Code could emphasise the need for this to be understood and for appropriate policies to be in place.',\n",
       " 'It was suggested that the Code could also address the need for market participants using algorithmic products to have in place processes to address potential adverse outcomes arising from the use of automated technology. In doing so, it might draw on the extensive thinking on these issues in supervisory and other circles. The use of platforms also raised issues of potential market concentration of the need to ensure contingencies were available in the event of a technology failure.',\n",
       " 'Technological advances in the dealing room had enhanced the potential for flexible working in the industry. In light of this it was proposed that where technology could assist with D&I objectives, firms should seek to enhance it, subject to ensuring appropriate oversight and control.',\n",
       " 'The group covering the impacts of regulatory reform over the past three years presented their findings. It noted that Environmental, Social and Governance factors had become increasingly prevalent in fixed income and money markets. It was suggested that the securities lending section of the Code might refer to UN Principles for Responsible Investing, Principles for Sustainable Securities Lending and Sustainable Development Goals.',\n",
       " 'It was also suggested that the Code could help promote transition away from LIBOR and towards the use of risk-free rates, something that could be helped by including standard calculations and conventions in the Glossary and Explanatory Note.',\n",
       " 'Market transparency was also highlighted as a key theme. It was noted that recent regulatory developments had been designed to make market data available to provide greater market transparency, however it was felt that more could be done to make greater use of these data.',\n",
       " 'Members also discussed the impact of regulation on movement of collateral in the financial system, in particular the impacts on market intermediation and liquidity. It was suggested having a further discussion on the impacts of regulatory reform on collateral at a future meeting of the MMC.',\n",
       " 'The Chair thanked working group members again for their thoughts and input. Many useful topics had been raised. In judging whether and how to include this material in a revised Code, the Committee and the wider membership would need to weigh the merits of broadening the Code, on the one hand, with the challenges that some members had reported in revalidating their compliance with new responsibilities. While there was support for many of the topics raised by the working groups, some members also noted that it was important to ensure that guidance in the Code should remain accessible to a broad range of market participants and should not inadvertently act as a barrier to signing up to the Code. Committee members agreed to reflect on what the Code update might include at the next meeting.',\n",
       " 'At its most recent meeting, the Sub-Committee had discussed the three-year review of the Code. It had been agreed that the timing of the review should be aligned with the three-year review of the FX Global Code, insofar as possible, beginning in earnest in 2020 Q1, with small working groups formed to look at each individual Chapter of the Code. Outputs from the three MMC discussion groups would provide one useful input for this process. On the cross-cutting issue of D&I, a session would be organised in early 2020 to look in detail at D&I and the Code. This would be a more informal meeting, and members of the Sub-Committee would bring along a colleague who would meet the diversity goals.',\n",
       " 'A brief update on the Public Register of Statements of Commitment and Statements of Support to the Code was provided. It was noted that since the Public Register launched just over a year previously, the number of firms that appeared on it had more than doubled. Split by firm type, there were 128 banks, 36 building societies, 14 broker-dealers, 3 CCPs, 17 asset managers, 3 brokers, 1 corporate, 6 local authorities, and 9 Statements of Support from organisations such as trade associations.',\n",
       " 'In light of these findings, the Sub-Committee had discussed the need to strengthen sign up to the Code amongst the corporate sector. One action agreed at the last meeting was for the Association of Corporate Treasurers (ACT) and Bank to create a short summary document to explain to corporate treasurers succinctly, clearly and effectively why their companies should sign up to the Code. That document had now been finalised, published on the Bank’s and ACT’s websites, and distributed by the ACT to its members. The effectiveness of these tools would need to be monitored over time.',\n",
       " 'A short discussion was held covering recent developments in market conditions since the last meeting.',\n",
       " 'The discussion began with a review of recent developments in US money markets. It was noted that in mid-September 2019, repo rates in the US had spiked significantly. The spike had been catalysed by a combination of an increased demand to borrow cash, decreased supply and decreased intermediation capacity. Set against the backdrop of quantitative tightening, mid-September reserves had been the lowest for seven years, increasing the sensitivity of short term market rates to the level of reserves in the system. The Federal Reserve had subsequently injected significant amounts of reserves through bill purchases and repo operations. Members of the Committee noted that the action taken by the Fed had been effective in stabilising rates, but the market was waiting for further clarity on what action the Fed may take in the medium to long term, for example whether a permanent Standing Repo facility may be launched, or furthermore how long T-bill purchases may continue for, and in what size. The implications of the spike in repo rates for risk-free rate transition were also discussed.',\n",
       " 'Members noted that they had seen no spillovers from the US money market dysfunction into sterling markets. Conditions had been orderly and markets had generally been liquid and well-functioning, although some movement in the cross currency basis had been observed. Some members noted that in the UK a broader range of money market participants had direct access to central bank facilities than in the US. That was viewed as one factor supporting sterling market conditions.',\n",
       " 'Conditions over 2019 year end were also discussed. It was agreed that year end had been orderly both in the UK and globally. In the US, repo rates had traded at only a small premium to the Fed funds rate, with a premium comparable to November’s month end, and well below that seen at the time of the 2018 year end. This was largely put down to action taken by the Fed in the preceding weeks. In sterling markets, year-end conditions had also been orderly and comparable to 2018. DBV repo rates had been elevated slightly on 30 and 31 December, as firms responded to regulatory incentives – but this had been largely expected, and followed the trend of previous quarter-ends. The secured RONIA index had seen low volumes around year end and perhaps unsurprisingly the brokered part of the market had seen the highest rates. Moves in the Sterling Repo index rate had been very contained, again indicating that what year end pressures there had been, were a function of cash management rather than any particular collateral stress. Members stressed that market had been well prepared heading into the turn, with most activity in the lead up taking place through mid-end December. It was commented that Money Market Funds tend to prepare for year-end throughout the year. Several members noted that through preparing for the General Election, much of the market had built up large amounts of liquidity. Several noted that in the local authority sector that had been an increase in inter-authority lending, which was largely a function of the recent increase in the Public Works Loan Board (PWLB) rate.',\n",
       " 'At their last meeting, the Securities Lending Committee had discussed a number of topical issues, namely: recent market trends; D&I; and ESG.',\n",
       " 'Revenues from Securities Lending activities had reportedly fallen by 15% YoY in H1 2019. A lack of hedge fund activity was said to be a key driver on the equity side, with members observing compressed fixed income spreads. It was noted that post-trade regulatory changes (e.g. SFTR & CSDR) had continued to be a key theme for the sector.

It had been noted that Europe and the UK were global leaders with respect to ESG investing. It was expected that focus on ESG matters would increase in the future as end-users became more focused on responsible investing. A number of key issues had been highlighted by SLC members for their forward agenda, including the importance of accountability and how legislation and regulation had evolved to acknowledge this; how ESG factors were being integrated among asset managers and asset owners; and the difficulties in determining the share of ESG investing as these securities were not classified in a binary way but in a sliding scale.',\n",

The group noted that a number of market participants such as local authorities, brokers and corporates are not well represented as signatories to the Code. In addition, although there is regulatory oversight, there is no specific reference to CCPs in the Code. Another key theme that emerged was around the promotion of D&I. The group noted in particular that the Code is currently silent on D&I but felt that this should be more actively promoted. The group also questioned how feedback around the Code is given, along with discussing how the Code could promote transparency. The group which focussed on the impacts of regulatory reform also presented on D&I initiatives and transparency, in addition to ESG investing, benchmark reform and collateral accessibility.',\n",

ESG should form a large part of any investment strategy, but the Committee was undecided on whether the Code is the best place to promote this. The results of the MMC discussion groups highlighted just how much the market has changed in the past three years.

The focus was on the objectives of the organisations and how well they worked together to meet the needs of cash users.

There was a close focus on value for money, which had been reviewed in depth with external consultants, using NAO taxonomy, at the most recent RRC meeting. Ms Cleland stressed the importance of the RTGS system, which settled £660bn each day, and the service was an integral part of CHAPS which settled high value and time- critical payments.

Integrating the Bank meant getting the Committees to work together while exercising their separate mandates, and the organisation supporting them to share information and analysis. So that in time there developed joint meetings of the FPC and the MPC, the PRA and the FPC working together on stress tests and the capital structure, and all three committees working through the implications and consequences of low for long.

       " 'IHS Markit’s presentation was delivered by Marcus Schüler, Head of Benchmark Administration. The provider’s term risk-free rate development work for the Australian dollar was being expanded to pound sterling and other currencies. IHS Markit is an FCA authorised Benchmark Administrator and prepares for administration of TSRRs as EU Critical Benchmarks in early-2020. It had a clear preference for using transaction data where possible but recognised sufficient RFR liquidity needed to continue to be developed. As a result, a waterfall approach had been established to support the robustness of term rate calculations.',\n",
       " 'In its methodology a TSRR curve would be constructed from both spot starting and forward starting OIS transactions as well as futures prices, over a 24 hour period. In most cases a hybrid approach using the OIS and futures data would be used, with OIS transactions as the starting point. OIS data would be sought from cleared transactions across a variety of trade execution methods (on-platform and OTC) meeting a minimum notional amount. The end-of-day base population of data would be validated and tested against the waterfall approach. The term structure would be calculated and published the following day. In the event of insufficient data, it was noted that a waterfall of fallbacks were present and this included previous days’ prices at the lower end of the waterfall. A compounded SONIA rate would act as the ultimate fallback.',\n",
       " 'The FCA reminded members that compounded overnight rates were expected to be used for most new business, with the TSRR intended to play a role only in a limited range of cash markets and fallbacks for legacy products. 15 major market makers in SONIA OIS  had been engaged on a bilateral basis  and collectively in July with broad support for streaming executable OIS quotes. Some had noted concerns that early availability of a TSRR might inhibit adoption of compounded SONIA as the primary market standard, and there was a preference for a testing period for firms to establish sufficient comfort in their ability to stream prices consistently. Both the Bank of England and the FCA were therefore supportive of planning for a period of ‘beta testing’ beginning from the Working Group’s Q1 2020 target3, with the date for full go-live kept under review.',\n",
       " 'One member queried whether market makers would be obliged to stream OIS quotes. The FCA confirmed there was no requirement, but a critical mass of liquidity providers had agreed to take part. The Bank of England noted that this was a business decision for the market makers involved.',\n",
       " 'The Term Rate Use Case Task Force had separately received updates from those providers previously confirmed to be developing TSRRs. Expected build times had varied, but the primary outstanding input required was the availability of pricing data as discussed above.',\n",
       " 'The Chair stated that priorities had been identified for the Working Group to progress over the next six months, and views were sought from members on how to take these forward. The priorities involved the encouragement of greater adoption of SONIA in cash markets and a further increase in volumes in SONIA derivatives. They also included the need to continue to support the design and adoption of robust fallbacks in contracts, momentum on TSRR development, and provide market input to identify issues around the expected ‘tough legacy’ of LIBOR stock where it may not be possible to change benchmark or insert fallbacks retrospectively.4 The Bank of England and the FCA also voiced support on the identified priorities.',\n",
       " 'Following discussion among members, a number of new actions were agreed to support the priorities, including: developing an information factsheet for cash market end-users; educating and raising awareness for UK regional centres; more international coordination; and analysing how to develop SONIA liquidity in non-linear derivatives. The Chair and the Secretariat would review and update the Working Group’s plans accordingly based on such ideas. The Regulatory Dependencies Task Force would be repurposed to provide market input to help identify issues around the ‘tough legacy’, responding to a call from Andrew Bailey for more public debate around the potential outcomes for legacy contracts that prove unable to convert or be amended to include fallbacks. The objective would be to establish the expected extent of these issues and likely market outcomes in the event of LIBOR cessation, any particular factors which lead contracts to be less likely to be able to convert, and any potential mitigants suggested by market participants to address the risks identified. The Chair of the Task Force emphasised that most suggestions aired so far had clear limitations on their effectiveness or deliverability, so it would be important for the group to consider the full range of risks as well as benefits to any options identified, and for market participants to continue to make every effort to avoid the uncertainty associated with retaining legacy exposures beyond the end of 2021.

Overall the Panel believed that international harmonisation would be a great benefit. But they cautioned that different regulatory environments could limit these benefits, though noted that greater standardisation might make it easier for regulators to consider such issues further. The Panel also cautioned that international harmonisation could inadvertently cause more fraud due to the speed money would be moving globally with increased process efficiency, which could put added pressure on PSPs.',\n",
       " 'Efficiencies in processing – by enabling improvements in straight-through-processing at PSPs, and reconciliations for end-users. The Panel thought that these are among the key benefits of ISO 20022. Discussion focused around the fact that the information has to be included by the sending party in order for benefit to be received, and how this could be incentivised.',\n",
       " 'Richer data – which could deliver benefit by enabling development of value added services to end users, enabling automation, and aggregate data allowing policy makers to build up a better picture of economic activity in the UK. The Panel agreed that an increase in data volume and structure would be a benefit, but it recognised the challenge in creating a KPI for this benefit, particularly noting that the benefits for firms would be very long term.',\n",
       " 'More generally the Panel suggested focusing on the specific elements of ISO 20022 which would enable delivery of benefits e.g. for interoperability it is alignment between NPA and CHAPS, and reduction in fraud is enabled by carrying more information about the purpose of a payment and  the identities of those involved in it. It may be easier to measure whether these have been delivered.',\n",
       " 'The Bank and Pay.UK opened the item by noting that they believe the transition to ISO 20022 presents a unique opportunity to realise many of the benefits discussed in Item 2. But many of these are network benefits, and rely on all members in the payment chain using a consistent implementation of ISO 20022. To realise these benefits would require a market wide effort, and the Bank and Pay.UK were therefore thinking about the most effective roles for each stakeholder group in delivering consistency, and the tools available to each group.',\n",
       " 'The Panel was clear that firms will require a clear value proposition, including the issues addressed along with the concerns that would come with not migrating to ISO 20022; this would particularly be the case for small, domestically focussed firms. The Panel agreed that, with some thinking, some clear and persuasive use cases could be easily produced. The Bank and Pay.UK had identified the need for market guidance and use cases, but that the creation and ownership of these is a market wide piece of work which the Bank and Pay.UK will facilitate and assist. The Panel agreed this was sensible.',\n",
       " 'The Bank and Pay.UK noted that corporates were a key stakeholder group to reach, as this is another participant group that will benefit from the usage of ISO 20022, and even those already using ISO 20022 would likely need to make some changes in order to realise the full benefits. . The Panel advised that corporate considerations should be included in the development of use cases and clear market guidance, ensuring that firms can and would deliver such benefits, for themselves and their customers. The Bank and Pay.UK added that communications with corporates, including through PSPs, would also be important.',\n",
       " 'Continuing on the topic of consistent usage of the ISO 20022 data set, some members of the Panel thought that it was important not to be prescriptive, allowing for innovation and for different groups with different needs, and that central systems should not be built by trying to guess the benefits that will be created from them. Consensus on market practice would then allow for selection of the best way to make a particular payment. Other members mentioned other products that had become unwieldy due to differing implementations of the relevant standard, and that these could have been avoided with a more centralised focus. With respect to ISO 20022, this could become an issue if consumers do not realise or are not made aware of the benefits from the extra data provided to them or if firms cannot realise the benefits of their investment due to their counterparties providing inconsistent data. The Bank and Pay.UK noted that such guidance could  be delivered by industry bodies or cross-industry groups. The Panel agreed that finding the optimal balance between market forces and central direction would be vital for a successful transition to ISO 20022.',\n",
       " 'Pay.UK outlined its approach to the implementation of ISO 20022 in the New Payments Architecture (NPA). At present, the UK retail payment service lines delivered by Faster Payments, Bacs and ICS provide an array of payments, and Pay.UK as the operator of these is faced with the rapid evolution of the payment landscape. As such, this necessitates a different approach to the previous ‘scheme led’ approach that currently exists today. Pay.UK outlined the phased approach for transition and consolidation onto the NPA as in the PSF Blueprint4 – layer one, the NPA core, is clearing and settlement, with rich functionality enabled by ISO 20022. In layer three, participants would be able to utilise the standard for their own payment type needs, using the payments rulebook.',\n",
       " 'One member suggested it would be useful to have a very specific industry rulebook for a particular payment type, and that Pay.UK could stop there being too many ways of making the same payment. But Pay.UK argued that allowing for competition between level three overlay services is a more effective way of facilitating innovation in the market.',\n",
       " 'Pay.UK expects to have defined the draft standard for the NPA core clearing and settlement layer by the end of the year. It expects to consult on this in early 2020.',\n",
       " 'Item 5: Industry Standards Coordination Committee and interactions with the Standards Advisory Panel',\n",
       " 'Pay.UK described the interactions of the Panel and Pay.UK’s Industry Standards Coordination Committee (ISCC), the committee recently launched by Pay.UK to focus on standards with each other and with Pay.UK. Pay.UK stated that both are places for its work to be scrutinised and challenged, though the ISCC is expected to be a more detailed and technical forum, while the Panel will offer strategic insight. It is expected that some issues from ISCC will be discussed by the Panel – particularly where strategic advice is needed on industry trade-offs.',\n",
       " 'A member of the Panel asked about the scope of Pay.UK’s Standards Authority. The Standards Authority is responsible for, and has authority over, all aspects of standards development, maintenance and modification across the scope of Pay.UK; inclusive of change programmes such as the NPA. The SA operates according to the standards framework which establishes methods of working, decision making and processed to maintain standards.  The SA has the duty to support  the development and delivery of standards according to the principles and procedures set out by the Pay.UK, and above all else that standards deliver benefits to the UK and its end-users.',\n",
       " 'Pay.UK went on to discuss some of its broader standards work. In particular mentioning its strong links with international PSOs and the regular meetings held to ensure consistency and gain insights from other entities implementing ISO 20022. The Bank added that it too works closely with',\n",
       " 'international HVPS operators. Pay.UK also noted that some work needs to be done to link up with card schemes, even though the card schemes are not yet adopting ISO 20022, for a number of reasons.',\n",
       " 'The Bank provided an update to the Panel on its approach to application programming interfaces (APIs) in the renewed RTGS system. The new RTGS system has been designed to improve the information available to RTGS account holders, and to allow them to interact with the Bank in a more automated and timely manner. The existing Enquiry Link service will be replaced with a series of APIs to enable account holders to both receive information and to send information/requests to the Bank. This will include specific requirements for CHAPS participants. At this stage there is no expectation that these APIs would be used to actually instruct a payment. It is expected that the Bank will provide a basic interface based on those APIs, though account holders could also seek to use those APIs to directly feed into their systems or for third party providers  to  develop  interfaces. There is not yet an international standard for the design of such APIs, but the Bank and Pay.UK have begun work with international partners to understand how this could be delivered (including SWIFT and other RTGS and HVPS operators).',\n",
       " 'At the last Panel meeting, a member raised the possibility of surveying their customers, in the  name of the Panel, to understand wider industry readiness. On further reflection, the Bank and Pay.UK felt that any survey branded by them would have to go wider than just the Panel members. But they encouraged the Panel to open communication lines with their customers, and work with them on ISO 20022 preparations.',\n",
       " 'The Bank and Pay.UK also noted that end users would be pivotal to a successful migration to ISO 20022, and that surveys would not be the only way to include their views. The Bank and Pay.UK recognised that the end users already involved in the process through industry engagement forums would have valuable input, including the Panel but also the Bank’s Strategic Advisory Forum and Pay.UK’s End User Advisory Council. The Bank and Pay.UK added that use cases would need to be tested on groups of end users, and opportunities to involve the wider payments landscape would arise throughout the migration and beyond.',\n",
       " 'The Panel asked the Bank and Pay.UK to build a forward look on Panel meetings to allow them to prepare well in advance. It also asked for a calendar of other events in the landscape and how they interact with the Panel. The Bank and Pay.UK agreed that both would be helpful, but said that they would be guides only and would be subject to change with the needs of the Bank and Pay.UK, and the wider market. Action: the Bank and Pay.UK to produce a provisional forward look and calendar of events in advance of the next meeting.',\n",

Materials from the project plan introduced at the last Working Group meeting, such as the high level roadmap, were expected to serve as a basis for relevant documentation to support this event.

The roadmap now also recognised where the Working Group were directly in control of some deliverables, and where items should be targeted through wider market engagement. The international elements of work would have to be progressed through broader engagement with working groups in other jurisdictions.

       " 'The role of the Advisory Group (previously sometimes referred to as the ‘senior sponsorship group’) was expanded upon. The Advisory Group would meet less frequently than the Working Group.  It  would be expected to provide strategic direction and support to the Working Group to deliver transition.

These individuals would be contacted after the Working Group meeting.',\n",
       " 'The revised governance structure on the Groups, Sub-Groups, and Task Forces was presented and agreed.

       " 'The Working Group re-iterated that compounded SONIA remained a suitable product more widely for end users and that it therefore intended to continue to promote it, in parallel to the work to develop a forward looking term rate for end users with the strongest use case. To ensure that market participants more widely did not wait for the development of a forward looking term rate, the Working Group agreed to set out the benefits for transitioning to compounded SONIA, building on its recent publication of the Discussion Paper on market conventions for referencing SONIA2.
