 I am grateful to Daisy McGregor and Simon Whitaker for their assistance in preparing these remarks, and to Fernando Eguren Martin, Lukas von dem Berge, Carlos Van Hombeeck, Simon Lloyd, Ambrogio Cesa-Bianchi, Nitya Aasaavari, Delma Essel, Sameeta Thakrar and Wayne Chapman for research and analysis. The research presented in this speech will be detailed in a forthcoming Bank of England working paper. It is a pleasure to be at the IIF. I would like to speak today about your raison d etre: sustainable cross border capital flows. Capital flows can be an enormous force for good. For example, when my native Canada was an emerging economy, net capital inflows averaged 10% of GDP every year for around three decades. After all, the IIF was founded 36 years ago in response to the Latin American debt crisis. That crisis was the product of an initially well founded and productive   but ultimately over exuberant and destructive   recycling of petro dollars by the banking system. That period provided painful examples both of how capital flows can support development and how capital flow volatility can undermine it. The Asian crisis almost 15 years later underscored the risks of relying on inflows that look stable but prove ephemeral. And subsequent crises in Latin America around the turn of the millennium and in advanced economies (AEs) a decade ago reinforced the risks of taking capital flows for granted. In theory, foreign capital inflows should support growth through greater allocative efficiency, better risk sharing and increased technology transfer. But in reality financial openness has proven a double-edged sword. The typical emerging market economy (EME) receiving higher capital inflows will grow 0.3 percentage points faster, all else equal (Chart 1). But the typical EME with higher capital flow volatility will grow 0.7 percentage points slower (Chart 2).1 Time and again, waves of investment into EMEs are sharply withdrawn (Chart 3). And more generally, financial openness has tended to amplify domestic imbalances and leave EMEs more vulnerable to foreign shocks.2 As a consequence, a fifth of all surges in capital flows to EMEs have ended in financial crises. And EMEs are at least three times more likely to experience a financial crisis after capital flow surges than in normal times.3 Given the uncertainty over the sustainability of capital inflows, EMEs have defensively accumulated reserves and limited the opening of their capital accounts, including by resorting to overt capital flow management in some cases. Overall, EMEs have increased their financial openness by considerably less than advanced economies (AEs) since 1980, leaving their external balance sheets only around a third the size of those in AEs, despite much faster growth in external trade (Chart 4). These responses, while understandable, carry significant opportunity costs. Excess precautionary savings in EMEs are pushing down equilibrium interest rates, increasing the risks of a global liquidity trap. And enormous cross border flows will be required to close EME infrastructure investment gaps and to finance the essential transition to a low carbon economy. Today, I want to examine what drives capital flow volatility and, in the process, sketch an agenda for sustainable capital flows in the new world order. Specifically, what should be the priorities to increase sustainable cross border capital flows? How many are the responsibility of the receiving country? What about the advanced economies who set the tone for the global financial cycle? And to what extent does the structure of the international monetary financial system itself, including the global safety net, determine safe flows? To begin to answer these questions, the Bank of England is developing a holistic  Capital Flows-at-Risk  framework that assesses the relative contribution of the three drivers of Capital Flows-at-Risk:4  Pull factors    domestic conditions and institutions that affect the relative attractiveness of investing in an individual country.  Push factors    that determine global risk appetite and financial conditions, particularly the level and prospects for US monetary policy and financial stability.  The Pipes    the structure of the global financial system itself, particularly the degree to which it dampens or amplifies shocks. The grey line in Chart 5 shows the unconditional distribution of capital flows, and the purple line shows how the distribution shifts in response to a negative shock.  Capital Flows-at-Risk  are defined as capital outflows in a severe, low-probability event (that with 5% probability or less). The left tail  fattens  if bad outcomes become more likely and/or the  5% probability event  becomes more severe   shown by the shift from A (Capital Flows-at-Risk of 1.2% of GDP) to B (Capital Flows-at-Risk of 4.2% of GDP). The Bank s framework can be used to assess policy options and associated trade-offs, and to communicate policy decisions. Today, I will provide some tentative conclusions in order to spur further debate and analysis, including as part of the IMF s work on its  Integrated Policy Framework  and the G20 discussions on the future of the financial architecture. Our core finding is that the distribution of capital flows will shift and change shape when there is a change in any of the three drivers   pull, push or pipes.5 In an interdependent world, everyone   advanced economies, emerging economies as well as the public and private sectors   is responsible for reducing capital flow volatility and increasing sustainable capital flows in order to meet the challenges of our age. ###newline###  The conventional wisdom, prior to the financial crisis, was that the best contribution each country can do for itself and others would be to  keep its own house in order .6   with an operationally independent and accountable central bank at their core   have generally delivered inflation rates that are both lower and less variable.7  This directly benefits all citizens in good times. Moreover, greater monetary policy credibility gives a central bank more scope to respond to shocks, and enables financial markets to anticipate better the path for monetary policy, thereby providing a stabilising force during bad times. During the taper tantrum, those economies with better- anchored inflation expectations were able to keep monetary policy relatively more accommodative.8 Flexible exchange rates. A flexible exchange rate acts as a valuable shock absorber for an economy because domestic wages and prices are relatively  sticky  (in other words, slow to adjust). For example, suppose there is a spike in global risk aversion. As capital flows are withdrawn flexible exchange rates depreciate. In general, this boosts an economy s competitiveness. However, where economies borrow heavily in foreign currency, and this exposure is unhedged, depreciations can be detrimental for the economy.9 Fiscal sustainability. A sustainable fiscal position provides governments with more room to respond to adverse shocks to demand. Financial markets therefore reward more sustainable fiscal positions: the IMF found that declines in inflows between 2010 and 2015 were 1 percentage points of GDP larger for countries with above-average public debt ratios.10 Fiscal sustainability is also necessary for a credible nominal anchor. An effective macroprudential policy toolkit to curtail the damaging extremes of domestic financial cycles. Macroprudential policy can guard against rapid credit growth, which is amongst the best early warning indicators of an impending downturn.11 And higher domestic bank capital ratios reduce the sensitivity of capital inflows to changes in global volatility.12 And deep domestic capital markets to reduce the reliance on foreign investors and the need to issue in foreign currency, which dampens capital flow volatility (Chart 6). The Bank of England s analysis finds that the conventional prescription to concentrate on putting one s own house in order had merit: pull factors were the main drivers of capital flow instability prior to the 2008 crisis (Chart 7). Over the years, this advice has been taken to heart.13 80% of EMEs are now inflation-targeters, compared to none just prior to the Asian Financial Crisis. These regimes have generally been successful: inflation has been low and stable across EMEs since the mid-2000s at a median rate of 2.5%, close to the rate in AEs. In many respects, the exceptions such as Argentina and Turkey prove the norm. Fiscal policy is more of a mixed picture; debt ratios are lower than in advanced economies but fiscal deficits have widened materially in recent years. In general, the resilience of emerging economy banking systems has increased with implementation of most of the FSB post-crisis reforms on track. EMEs are the most active users of macroprudential policy. However, while there has been progress in developing domestic capital markets   the depth of EME financial markets has doubled since the turn of millennium   this has been insufficient to meet rising financing needs. As a result, the share of FX-denominated debt has increased sharply (Chart 8). And while domestic markets have deepened, the share of foreign ownership in EME local currency bond markets has risen, up from 5% on average pre-crisis to around 25% today. Despite these vulnerabilities, the Bank s analysis finds that, for EMEs as a whole, reforms to domestic institutional  pull factors  have substantially increased the sustainability of capital flows and so shifted the distribution of capital flows to the right (Chart 9), all else equal. ###newline###  Unfortunately for EMEs, all else has not been equal. The importance of  push factors  has increased over time as monetary policy and financial stability shocks in advanced economies have become both more prevalent and more potent. And push factors are arguably becoming more important as the fundamental asymmetry at the heart of the global economy deepens. When the IIF was founded, EMEs made up a little more than 1/3 of global GDP. Since the last Fed tightening cycle, their share of global activity has risen from around 45% to 60%. By 2030, it is projected to rise to around three quarters. But while the real global economy is being reordered, the international monetary financial system has barely begun its transition. The dollar represents the currency of choice for at least half of international trade invoices, two-thirds of global securities issuance, it denominates two-thirds of EME foreign currency external debt and acts as the monetary anchor in countries accounting for 70% of global GDP.14 In fact, the dollar is as dominant today as it was during the Bretton Woods era, and is likely to remain so for some time, as its roles in international payments, as a reserve asset and a funding currency are mutually reinforcing. 15 This means developments in the US have disproportionate influence on global economic and financial conditions. Indeed, our research suggests that the influence of US financial conditions on foreign GDP has increased by a third relative to its average from 1990 to 2005, despite the US s rapidly declining share of global GDP. In total, push factors from AEs have weighed more heavily over the past decade, which has offset some of the improvement in  pull factors , and shifted the distribution of capital flows back to the left (Chart 11). Keeping one s own house in order is necessary but not sufficient for sustainable capital flows in the new world order.16 ###newline###  This underscores the importance of the third driver of Capital Flows-at-Risk, the Pipes, or the structure of the global financial system itself. First, over the past decade G20 reforms have made the core safer, simpler and fairer, which has reduced Capital Flows-at-Risk. Large global banks  common equity requirements and buffers are ten times higher than the pre-crisis standard. In keeping with new global liquidity standards, banks have changed their funding models and their liquid assets   relative to their liabilities that can readily run   are tenfold higher now than before the crisis. Regulation has also made banks less complex and more focused. Trading assets have been cut in half, and interbank lending is down by one-third. Second, the growth in assets under management, from around $50 trillion a decade ago to over $80 trillion today, is bringing welcome diversity to the financial system, but is also increasing the risks of sudden stops and sharp capital reversals. For EMEs, market-based finance has accounted for all the increase in foreign lending since the crisis, as bank lending has declined and FDI has stayed fairly constant (Chart 12). Within market-based finance, investment funds are growing, accounting for the bulk of the growth in asset management over the last decade. In parallel, investment fund flows to EMEs now account for around one third of total portfolio flows, compared to around one tenth pre-crisis. These flows are particularly flighty (Chart 13), reflecting the fact that more than $30 trillion of global assets are held in investment funds that promise daily liquidity to investors despite investing in potentially illiquid underlying assets, such as EME debt.17 We have recently seen analogous situations in the UK within some niche managers and smaller markets, such as open-ended property funds investing in commercial real estate.18 The complications would be much greater if a major asset class like EME debt were to freeze up. This structural mismatch means that these funds can behave particularly pro-cyclically. Bank of England work finds that redemptions by EME bond funds (those with larger structural mismatches) in response to price falls are five times those for EME equity funds (those with less structural mismatch). In turn, EME equity funds are twice as responsive as AE equity funds. While the shift to market-based finance has increased global capital flows to EMEs, it also amplifies spikes in Capital Flows-at-Risk. Moreover, market-based finance flows are particularly sensitive to push shocks, especially in extreme scenarios (Chart 13). The recent global growth in assets under management has not yet been fully tested in an extreme scenario, such as a global downturn. The third aspect of the pipes is the global financial safety net (GFSN). Developments in this regard have arguably further increased Capital Flows-at-Risk. The GFSN has become more fragmented over the past two decades and its core   IMF resources   has shrunk relative to the size of the global financial system (Chart 14). As a result, individual countries have chosen to self-insure at high cost to both themselves and the rest of the world. While the IMF s nominal resources have more than tripled over the past decade, they still only represent around 1% of global gross external liabilities and have been on a downward trend from 2.5% in 1980. Other multilateral arrangements, such as Regional Financing Arrangements (RFAs) and swap lines, are only partial substitutes. RFAs are largely untested and swap lines may only be used in very specific situations between specific countries. There is no evidence the formal GFSN deters countries from holding reserves.19 The extra reserves that EMEs have accumulated over the past two decades have reduced the sensitivity of Capital Flows-at-Risk to Push factors by almost 50%. But this extra insurance has come at a domestic high cost, both to finance and because reserves can crowd out domestic investment.20 And it has global externalities, with the vast accumulation of safe assets distorting yields, building global imbalances and increasing the risks of a global liquidity trap.21 Augmenting the Bank of England s Capital Flows-at-Risk framework with the major structural changes in the global financial system materially changes the Bank s assessment of the quantum of Capital Flows-at-Risk when there are push shocks. In particular, we estimate that the growing shares of FX-denominated debt, market-based intermediation and, within that, the increasing role of investment funds, have increased the sensitivity of Capital Flows-at-Risk to push factors by 50% since the crisis (second bar, Chart 15)   largely using up the self-insurance purchased by EMEs. If history serves as a guide to the evolution of EME balance sheets, EMEs  external liabilities could double as a share of GDP by 2030: market-based finance could then account for half of external liabilities, up from one- third today. And if investment funds keep growing as they have over the past few years they could represent 40% of market-based finance flows to EMEs in a decade s time. 22 These flows will benefit EMEs in good times, but if domestic institutional frameworks do not evolve in parallel, they could also be major sources of instability. By 2030, the sensitivity of Capital Flows-at-Risk to push factors could triple (fourth bar, Chart 15). This would fully cancel out the positive impact of domestic reforms in EMEs over the past two decades: the shift left in the distribution when there is a push shock (grey distribution, Chart 16) is likely to be at least as great as the shift right that we have seen over the past two decades because of improvements in pull factors. While these calculations should be taken with a grain of salt, they suggest that in a new world order that combines growing market-based finance with a deepening asymmetry at the heart of the international monetary financial system, fast reforming EMEs could be running to stand still in their quest for higher sustainable capital flows. ###newline###  This possibility underscores that everyone must contribute to building the sustainable capital flows we need. Emerging market economies should continue determined reform of domestic institutional frameworks to turn pull factors into insulators rather than amplifiers. Historically, countries have only benefited from financial openness once they reach a critical threshold of financial depth and institutional quality.23 EMEs therefore need to reinforce the significant progress they have made on monetary policy credibility, including safeguarding central bank independence. Fiscal space will need to be used carefully given ongoing structural imperatives, the rising risks of global shocks, and the clear limits of monetary policy. To realise fully the benefits of financial openness EMEs need to reinforce banking system resilience and deepen their domestic capital markets, particularly to reduce reliance on foreign-denominated debt.24 It will be particularly important for EMEs to continue to develop macroprudential policy toolkits to guard against excessive credit growth and high levels of indebtedness. Tightening of prudential policy in EMEs dampens the spillover from US monetary policy tightening by around a quarter,25 and reduces Capital Flows-at-Risk So many of the traditional imperatives for EMEs remain, but the Bank of England s analysis shows that keeping one s house in order won t be sufficient, the neighbourhood too must change.26 As EMEs have grown as a share of the global economy, so too have  spillbacks  to advanced economies. The projected rise in capital flow volatility because of structural changes in the global financial system could take 1.2 percentage points off EME growth by 2030, all else equal. Rising  spillbacks  to advanced economies means growth there could also be at least 0.2 percentage points lower.27 And while it is unrealistic to expect advanced economy policymakers to internalise fully spillovers from their actions on emerging markets, given their domestic mandates, AE monetary policies will increasingly need to take account of spillbacks. The spillover from a one standard deviation tightening in US financial conditions now reduces GDP for the average emerging market economy by around 0.2%, twice its 1990-2004 average. And the spillback from a 1% hit to EME GDP now drags on US activity by 0.15%, compared to 0.1% in 1990. Taking the two together, spillbacks from a tightening in US financial conditions have tripled - accounting for around 6% of the impact of changes in US financial conditions on US GDP. These effects will grow as financial integration continues. Continued transparency around monetary policy will also help EMEs to anticipate Capital Flows-at-Risk, and take pre-emptive actions where warranted. As long as there remains a fundamental asymmetry between the multi-polar global economy and dollar- dominated international monetary financial system, absent other reforms EMEs may turn to Capital Flow Management (CFM) measures to safeguard financial stability in the face of push shocks. For example, limits on foreign currency borrowing and restrictions on the activities of open-ended investment funds could help EMEs to avoid dangerous build-up in volatile debt. But there are clear shortcomings to CFMs. History has shown them to be addictive and often highly distortionary. That is why the IMF s Institutional View makes clear that CFMs should not substitute for domestic institutional reforms nor warranted macroeconomic adjustments. There are two major challenges in operationalising CFMs. The first is proving intent so as not to provoke retaliation. The second is that they can panic investors and make matters worse. A Capital Flows-at-Risk framework might help with these judgements. If authorities can develop and agree a holistic approach it could inform policy actions, including the occasional disciplined use of Capital Flow Management tools in EMEs and the deployment of macroprudential measures in AEs. Indeed, policymakers in  push  economies also have special responsibilities to manage risks in these global public goods. This is especially the case for the Bank of England, given the City s role as the world s leading internationally active financial centre. Recognising that the City is a global public good, we have transformed the resiliency of UK-based banks, we are well on the path to ending too-big-to-fail, and we have overhauled our liquidity facilities to support continuously open markets.28 We have simplified the complex and opaque web of OTC derivatives trade. And we have convened market participants to develop new standards of market practice, such as the Global FX Code and the FMSB standards for FICC markets. The UK s Senior Managers Regime (SMR) gives teeth to voluntary codes by incentivising firms to embed them and by re- establishing the link between seniority and accountability. The Bank s findings suggest that the global macroprudential responsibilities of AEs will likely extend to the oversight of market-based finance given its potential for major cross-border spillovers. Over half of investment funds have a structural mismatch between the frequency with which they offer redemptions and the time it would take them to liquidate their assets.29 Under stress they may need to fire sell assets, magnifying market adjustments and triggering further redemptions   a vicious feedback loop that can ultimately disrupt market functioning. Two-thirds of investment funds with structural mismatches are domiciled in the US and Europe so, as is the case for banks, ensuring leverage and liquidity risks are managed in funds investing abroad is both a national asset and a global public good. System-wide stress simulations are currently being developed, including at the Bank of England, to assess these risks.30 And authorities are beginning to consider macroprudential policy tools to guard against the build-up of systemic risks in non-banks. Regulators currently have far less sight of risks within funds compared to the core banking system, particularly synthetic leverage arising from funds  use of derivatives. IOSCO is consulting on a set of metrics for measuring leverage. To be most decision-useful, these need to be consistent and comprehensive across countries. The upcoming FSB-IOSCO evaluation of implementation and effectiveness of recommendations to address liquidity mismatch in funds will be crucial to improve our understanding of best practice, including the merits of adjustments to redemption periods to be more consistent with investments. We are mindful that these decisions could have global as well as local implications. And we would welcome the IIF s contributions to informing these judgements. Better surveillance, a more resilient core of the financial system and a macroprudential approach to market- based finance will all help increase sustainable capital flows, but they will be most effective if they are underpinned by an adequate GFSN. Pooling resources at the IMF is much more efficient than individual countries self-insuring against Capital Flows-at-Risk, distributing the costs across all 189 member countries. To maintain reserve adequacy in the face of future larger and more risky external balance sheets, EMEs would need to double their current level of reserves over the next 10 years   an increase of $9 trillion. A better alternative would be to hold $3 trillion in pooled resources, achieving the same level of insurance for a much lower cost.31 This would imply a tripling in the IMF s resources over the next decade, enough to maintain their current share of global external liabilities.32 The design of the GFSN is also important. Positive steps have been made in recent years by introducing precautionary liquidity facilities so countries can borrow to prevent crises, as well as mitigate their impact. This should also reduce stigma of drawing on the facilities. But so far, only a few countries have taken them up. It is important to do everything we can to normalise use of these precautionary facilities.33 ###newline###  In the deceptively simpler time of the pre-crisis world order,  keeping your house in order  was a handy prescription of the G7 to EMEs. When countries were hit by volatile capital flows, they were admonished that there were  no innocent bystanders  and that only by doubling down on the Washington Consensus reforms could they be free to enjoy the benefits of sustainable cross-border investment. The experience of successive crises and shocks   confirmed by the Bank of England s analysis   suggests that advice was once worthy but is increasingly incomplete. The significant improvements in the institutional frameworks of EMEs are being offset by the deepening fundamental asymmetry in the international monetary financial system, the continued shrinking of the GFSN, and the rapid rise of market-based finance. We are all responsible for addressing the fault lines in the global financial system and its safety net. The IIF with its diverse and global membership can make a major contribution. In doing so we will reduce the volatility of capital flows, increase the sustainability of cross-border investment, and meet the great challenges of our age. The Bank s capital flows-at-risk (KF@R) framework is based on the use of quantile regression methodology. It models the entire distribution of gross capital inflows to emerging market economies (EMs) based on a set of covariates, and focuses on the dynamics of the left tail of those conditional distributions, which is taken to be the relevant measure of capital flows-at-risk. In the baseline specification, the distribution of capital flows is estimated conditional on proxies for  push   and  pull  factors. For this purpose, the framework makes use of in-house financial conditions indices (FCIs), which measure co-movement in a series of financial indicators at the country level.34 The global average of these indices is considered to be a summary measure of  push  factors, and the residual obtained from regressing country indices on this global FCI to be a country-specific summary measure of  pull  factors. For different horizons (h) and quantiles ( ) of the distribution, a panel regression of capital flows is performed on a constant, and the proxies for push and pull factors:35 This specification allows capital flows-at-risk to be estimated, which is measured as the 5th percentile of the distribution in the baseline case. This specification is estimated on quarterly gross-inflows from non-residents to a set of 13 EMs over the period 1996-2018.36 The specification is estimated separately for FDI, banking and portfolio flows, and a split of portfolio flows into those intermediated via investment funds and those which are not. The analysis focuses on the effect of push and pull shocks on capital flows in the contemporaneous quarter and the subsequent two quarters. In a second specification the role of a set of additional factors (X) in affecting the sensitivity of capital flows- at-risk to global push shocks is considered. This is done by adding an interactive effect to equation (1):37 KF@R =       +        +       +      X +      (     X) +  (2) A series of factors is considered: in one specification the focus is on the share of foreign currency- denominated debt and a measure of reserve adequacy, while in another specification the role of macro- prudential policy is analysed.
