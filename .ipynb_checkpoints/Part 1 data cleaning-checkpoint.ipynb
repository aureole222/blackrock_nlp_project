      "The greatest problem in international finance is Too Big To Fail. So long as it lies uncured, banking cannot assume its proper role at the heart of a market economy. Fortunately, a group of people – private sector as well as official sector – are determined to make distressed banks and dealers resolvable without taxpayer solvency support. That is what G20 Leaders have told us to do. Many people in this room are helping us get there. It will embarrass him to have to read this out but, through his role at the centre of the Financial Stability Board, Svein has been heroic in these efforts, and it is right that he collects this evening’s award. Eva Huepkes of FSB and Peter Brierley of the Bank of England also share the credit. But, truly, it is an endeavour shared with many of the lawyers in this room, who have been and will remain central to finding solutions. By combining bail-in as a resolution tool with living wills – in the form of what amount to Chapter XI-style pre-packs – we can put TBTF behind us. In fact, it is within reach. Progress in operationalising bail-in is being made; and countries are enhancing their statutory regimes. Both need a big continuing commitment. Let’s get there. Thanks again for working with Svein and me on this.\n"

       "['It is almost exactly a year since Lehman Brothers collapsed, precipitating a near-fatal heart attack for the global financial system. And in its wake came an unprecedentedly sharp and synchronised contraction in global economic activity, from which we are only just starting to emerge. In part, that stabilisation reflects the intensity of the countervailing policy actions by governments and central banks around the world.',\n",
       " 'Injections of capital, funding guarantees, ring-fencing of toxic assets and abundant liquidity support have helped to return the banking system towards normality, though the process of balance-sheet repair still has some way to go. And substantial increases in fiscal deficits and aggressively expansionary monetary policies have helped to arrest the fall in spending, output and employment.',\n",
       " 'For its part, the Bank of England s Monetary Policy Committee not only cut Bank Rate from 5% in September last year to just 0.5% in February, but also embarked on a programme of large scale asset purchases financed by the issuance of extra reserves   so-called  Quantitative Easing . This unlovely phrase was originally coined to describe a related policy conducted by the Bank of Japan in the early part of this decade and has perhaps lost something in the translation. But sadly it is a phrase that we are now well and truly stuck with.',\n",
       " 'Like a lot of our operations, Quantitative Easing can seem a bit mysterious and confusing to those not steeped in what central banks do. As much of this confusion arises from a misunderstanding of the Bank of England s accounts, I am therefore delighted to be speaking to an audience of accountants, who might find this arcane subject rather exciting!',\n",
       " 'In January this year, the Chancellor authorised the Bank to create a new fund   the Asset Purchase Facility   for the purpose of buying assets from the private sector. Any profits on the Asset Purchase Facility are passed to Her Majesty s Treasury, while any losses are also indemnified by the Exchequer. The accounts are therefore not consolidated with the Bank s own accounts, as the Bank has no economic interest in the fund.',\n",
       " 'Initially, the Facility purchased commercial paper, funded by the proceeds of sales of short-term Treasury bills by the Debt Management Office. This asset swap took credit risk onto the public sector s balance sheet and was therefore more akin to a fiscal operation. But since March, purchases have been on a much larger scale and funded through the issuance of central bank reserves rather than Treasury bills. The bulk of the purchases have been of government bonds, though a small quantity of investment-grade corporate bonds have also been bought. So far, about  164 billion of assets have been purchased in this way, as against the Monetary Policy Committee s current target of  175 billion. To put that in perspective,  175 billion represents roughly 12% of annual GDP.',\n",
       " 'Technically what happens is the following. The Asset Purchase Facility buys assets funded by a loan from the Bank. In turn, the Bank funds that loan through additional reserve creation (Chart 1). If this sounds like financial alchemy, consider how the money flows through the system. When the Asset Purchase Facility buys a gilt from a pension fund, say, it can be thought of as paying with a cheque drawn on the Bank of England. The pension fund will then bank the cheque with its own commercial bank, so the latter now has a claim on the Bank of England   that is what reserves are. In reality, these payments are not made by cheque, but rather are carried out electronically. But the principle is the same, though one key difference is that we pay Bank Rate to the commercial bank on its claim on us, as well as charging Bank Rate on the loan we make to the Asset Purchase Facility.',\n",
       " 'Now I can add detours for the money at any point in this cycle. For example, the pension fund that sold the gilt to the Asset Purchase Facility might now withdraw its deposit and use it to purchase a newly issued corporate bond. The company issuing the bond then deposits that money in their own bank. So now it is the corporate s bank that holds the claim on us. A similar sort of circle occurs if the corporate then uses its deposit to buy a new piece of machinery, because the seller of that machinery will end up putting the proceeds into her bank, so that the claim on the Bank of England is now held by the capital goods producer s bank. Whatever the type of',\n",
       " 'purchase, it will always end up with someone s commercial bank having a claim on us. That is even the case if the money is used to buy foreign goods, as the foreign commercial bank will need to exchange the sterling claim with a commercial bank that holds an account with us, if it does not do so itself. The only way that the claim can be eliminated from the system is if a bank chooses to exchange it for cash, which would make little sense since cash pays no interest at all.',\n",
       " 'The reason for going through this in such mind-numbing detail is to make the point that the level of commercial banks  reserves in aggregate is determined by the way we have funded the asset purchases, not by the commercial banks  own decisions. The size of banks  reserves cannot, as is frequently claimed, be a sign that they are  sitting on them . No matter how rapidly or how slowly the economy is growing, or how fast or slow the money is circulating, the aggregate amount of reserves will be exactly the same. So it should be clear that the quantity of central bank reserves held by the commercial banks is useless as an indicator of the effectiveness of Quantitative Easing.',\n",
       " 'Now obviously we would prefer that the money circulates more rapidly and that this is done through increased bank lending and deposit taking. In other words, we would like to see a further expansion of credit and broad money. Since the banks collectively are now awash with reserves, they should not be prevented from making additional loans because of any liquidity concerns. Banks are, though, constrained by a lack of capital and are looking to reduce leverage rather than increase it.',\n",
       " 'Fortunately, increased bank lending is not necessary for Quantitative Easing to work. Indeed, it was precisely because the Monetary Policy Committee expected the additional monetary injection not to stimulate bank lending directly at the current juncture, that the Asset Purchase Facility s purchases were targeted at assets held primarily by the non-bank private sector1. So if the Asset Purchase Facility buys gilts',\n",
       " 'from pension funds or asset managers, they will then have to look for another home for their money. As it is not very rewarding just to hold it on deposit, they are likely to look to put their money into other assets, including equities and corporate bonds. Thus not only does the price of gilts rise as a consequence of the Asset Purchase Facility s initial purchases, but also the prices of a whole spectrum of other assets.',\n",
       " 'That in turn lowers the cost of non-bank finance and encourages increased corporate issuance. Also the rise in asset prices increases wealth and improves balance sheets. In this way, Quantitative Easing helps to work around the blockage created by a banking system that is still undergoing a process of balance sheet repair.',\n",
       " 'That is exactly what we have seen since the Monetary Policy Committee started its asset purchase program. Gilt yields fell sharply, though they have subsequently risen and fallen again (Chart 2). But gilt yields can move for a variety of reasons, including changing expectations of future interest rates. If we control for that by comparing gilt yields with a measure of market expectations of the future level of Bank Rate (Overnight Indexed Swap rates for an equivalent maturity), we find that this spread has fallen by around   percentage point (Chart 3). Moreover, no such movement is observed in either the United States or euro area, which strongly suggests that the movement may be related to our gilt purchases2. More importantly for the real economy, sterling investment-grade corporate bond spreads have fallen over three and a half percentage points since the start of Quantitative Easing (Chart 4). And equity prices have risen by almost a half, the fifth largest increase in a six-month period over the past three hundred years (Chart 5). Accompanying this, UK companies have issued over  60 billion worth of bonds and equities since January, compared with an annual average of around  40 billion in recent years (Chart 6). Moreover, the spread between the three-month interbank rate over expected Bank Rate, which had been unusually elevated during the crisis, particularly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, has fallen by almost 1  percentage points and is now more or less back to pre-crisis levels (Chart 7).',\n",
       " 'All this suggests that Quantitative Easing is having the expected effects on the economy. However, there may also be other reasons why asset prices have recovered in recent months. Early in the year, there were considerable fears that the recession would continue to deepen, whereas it now seems that activity here and elsewhere has probably troughed, so some of the worst downside risks look unlikely to crystallise. And asset prices have been rising not only here, but elsewhere, though that could reflect the aggressive monetary policy measures adopted by other central banks too.',\n",
       " 'Moreover, the ultimate aim of the policy is to get the annual rate of growth of nominal spending in the economy back to the 5% or so that it averaged during the first decade of the Monetary Policy Committee s existence and which is consistent with inflation at target and growth at trend. In contrast, over the past year, nominal spending has fallen by roughly 5% (Chart 8). The  175 billion of asset purchases has been calibrated with this in mind, though it will be some while yet before we know how effective the policy has been in achieving the objective.',\n",
       " 'Indeed, the truth is that we will probably never know exactly how effective the policy of Quantitative Easing has been, for the simple reason that we can never know with precision what would have happened in its absence. My only confident prediction is that academic economists and their PhD students will be poring over the topic for decades to come.',\n",
       " 'To conclude, I want to return to some accounting issues. As I noted earlier, the Asset Purchase Facility is set up as a separate entity, indemnified by the Treasury. The Bank is committed to transparency about its operations, and we will be publishing annual accounts for the Asset Purchase Facility, drawn up in accordance with established international accounting principles.',\n",
       " 'The Asset Purchase Facility receives coupon payments from the government on the gilts it holds, as well as some income from its small holding of corporate assets. The Asset Purchase Facility also pays interest at Bank Rate to the Bank of England on the',\n",
       " 'loan used to buy the assets. At present, the average coupon on the purchased gilts is around 5%, which substantially exceeds Bank Rate at 0.5%. Consequently the net interest income of the Fund is positive. But international accounting principles dictate that the assets on the balance sheet of the Asset Purchase Facility are also marked to market. Since gilt prices are highly sensitive to movements in discount rates, it is quite plausible that falls in the prices of gilts as a result of any future increase in discount rates will leave the Asset Purchase Facility accounts in deficit overall.',\n",
       " 'The question is: Does this matter? At first sight, any loss on the Asset Purchase Facility would represent a cost to the taxpayer, given the Treasury indemnity. But of course the gilts held in one part of the public sector, the Asset Purchase Facility, are just a liability of the rest of the public sector. In the accounts for the rest of the public sector, there must therefore be offsetting interest flows, as well as corresponding capital gains or losses, at least if those accounts were also to be marked to market. So gilt price movements necessarily all wash out once the public accounts are compiled on a consistent basis, at least so long as the assets are retained within the public sector3.',\n",
       " 'We do not, however, expect to retain all the purchased assets in the Asset Purchase Facility to maturity. At some stage, as the recovery proceeds, the Monetary Policy Committee will need gradually to remove the large monetary stimulus that we have imparted to the economy, otherwise we will be in danger of overshooting our 2% inflation target.  That monetary tightening will take the form of some combination of a higher level of Bank Rate and asset sales from the Asset Purchase Facility to the private sector. The process of selling off the gilts can then be expected to push gilt yields back up towards where they would have been in the absence of the Quantitative Easing programme. When the Asset Purchase Facility is finally run down, won t the closing accounts tell us about the benefits or costs of the programme?',\n",
       " 'The answer to this is: No. The first point to make is that the aim of Quantitative Easing and the Asset Purchase Facility is to help the Monetary Policy Committee',\n",
       " 'achieve its macroeconomic objective, namely hitting the Government s inflation target without generating undue volatility in output. The accounts of the Asset Purchase Facility are not designed to address these overall macroeconomic costs or benefits, which instead requires an assessment of the impact of Quantitative Easing on demand and inflation. As I have already noted, this is a difficult issue which is likely to keep researchers busy for many years to come.',\n",
       " 'Second, even if one were interested in the rather narrower issue of the impact of Quantitative Easing on the public finances, whether the Treasury ends up with a profit or a loss from the Asset Purchase Facility represents only a small part of the picture. Gilt yields will be lower than they would otherwise have been during the period that they are held in the Asset Purchase Facility, so reducing the cost of financing a given budget deficit. This needs to be factored into any calculation of the implications for the public finances. Rather more significantly, Quantitative Easing is intended to boost spending and activity. In the process, it should raise tax revenues and reduce benefit payments. And, unless Quantitative Easing proves to be largely ineffective, this effect is likely to dominate the other elements of the calculation.',\n",
       " 'Finally, it is worth noting that normal monetary policy, conducted by varying Bank Rate, also generally affects both gilt yields and activity. Consequently, it too has an influence on the public finances, including through the Bank s balance sheet. Yet we usually do not try to conduct such an exercise. The success of policy is instead judged by whether the macroeconomic objectives are met.',\n",
       " 'The moral from all this is one that will be all too familiar to you as accountants, though perhaps one that sometimes gets forgotten by consumers of accounting statements, namely that the appropriate way to frame accounts depends on how they will be used and what questions are being asked. The Asset Purchase Facility accounts may tell us the scale of gains or losses on the Asset Purchase Facility portfolio narrowly considered, but will miss the impact on the public finances from higher activity and lower financing costs and fail to tell us anything about it macroeconomic effectiveness. The rise in asset prices and the recovery in confidence',\n",
       " 'since the start of the Quantitative Easing program have been significant. We cannot identify precisely how much of this is a direct result of Quantitative Easing, and hence the scale of the boost to tax revenues. I have no doubt that this issue will continue to be debated for years to come, and that some sceptics may remain unconvinced. But even a sceptic should acknowledge that the net accounting gain or loss on the Asset Purchase Facility provides an incomplete measure of the impact of Quantitative Easing on the economy and on the public finances.']"

The ONS had highlighted that a substantial part of that weakness reflected a fall in household expenditure on transport, which in turn was related to the sharp decline in new cars registered following the introduction of increased Vehicle Excise Duty on high-polluting vehicles in April. New car sales had since remained well below the levels seen earlier in the year, though they had recovered somewhat from their April lows, implying a slight boost to overall consumption growth in the third quarter. Consistent with the spending data, the Finance & Leasing Association had reported a sharp slowdown in new car finance in the second quarter. More broadly, there had been tentative signs of a modest tightening of lending criteria in the personal loan and credit card markets.

Recent weakness in confidence had been driven by households becoming more pessimistic about the general economic situation and their willingness to make major purchases. Most housing market data had, in contrast, been slightly firmer.

Approached from the expenditure side, the Committee judged that most early indicators were consistent with a somewhat stronger profile for consumption growth in Q3 than the 0.2% rate that had been incorporated into the Inflation Report.

During the negotiation period, those economic implications would be influenced significantly by the expectations of households, firms and financial markets about the United Kingdom’s eventual economic relationships with the European Union and other countries, and the transition to them.  The United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union involved structural economic adjustments over which monetary policy had very little or no influence.

GDP had risen by 0.3% in the second quarter, as expected in the MPC’s August projections. Although the initial breakdown of growth by expenditure component had shown notable weakness in consumption, business investment and net trade, these were early estimates that were prone to revision. Moreover, a substantial part of the weakness in household consumption in Q2 was related to a reduction in new car sales, which was expected to unwind partially in Q3.  Looking beyond Q2, retail sales volumes had risen and housing market data had also generally been slightly firmer. Taken together, the Committee judged that most early indicators were consistent with a somewhat stronger profile for consumption growth in Q3 than had been incorporated into the Inflation Report.

That might be expected to support household incomes, and hence consumption, even as increases in pay per worker remained modest. Recent activity and employment data had also pointed to weak productivity growth, corroborating the MPC’s forecast for modest potential supply growth.

Since then, the economic data had been broadly in line with those projections.

Moreover, an earlier tightening of policy could mitigate the risks from a more sustained period of above-target inflationary pressure that might ultimately necessitate a more abrupt change in policy and hence a greater adjustment in growth and employment.

Consumer confidence had also remained subdued. While there had been some signs of growing momentum in activity into the second half of the year – in particular stronger employment data, signs of a pickup in the housing market, and a partial rebound in new car sales – it was too soon to judge whether stronger consumption growth would be sufficient to offset continuing weakness in business investment. It was also unclear how sustained any increase in GDP growth might be over the medium term. And, although there had been a few more positive signs on wage growth, there was not yet evidence of the sustained pickup incorporated in the August Inflation Report projection.

      " The Bank of England s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 13 September 2017, the MPC voted by a majority of 7-2 to maintain Bank Rate at 0.25%. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  10 billion.  The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  435 billion. The MPC set out its most recent assessment of the outlook for inflation and activity in the August Inflation Report. That assessment depended importantly on three main judgments: that the lower level of sterling continues to boost consumer prices broadly as projected, and without adverse consequences for inflation expectations further ahead; that regular pay growth remains modest in the near term but picks up over the forecast period; and that subdued household spending growth is largely balanced by a pickup in other components of demand. Since the August Report, the relatively limited news on activity points, if anything, to a slightly stronger picture than anticipated. GDP rose by 0.3% in the second quarter, as expected in the MPC s August projections, although initial estimates of private final demand were softer than anticipated. The unemployment rate has continued to decline, to 4.3%, its lowest in over 40 years and a little lower than forecast in August. Survey indicators are consistent with continued strength in employment growth. Evidence continues to accumulate that the rate of potential supply growth has slowed in recent years. Overall, the latest indicators are consistent with UK demand growing a little in excess of this diminished rate of potential supply growth, and the continued erosion of what is now a fairly limited degree of spare capacity. Underlying pay growth has shown some signs of recovery, albeit remaining modest. The sterling exchange rate has been volatile and the price of oil has increased. Headline and core CPI inflation in August were slightly higher than anticipated. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose to 2.9% and is now expected to rise to above 3% in October. The circumstances since the referendum on EU membership, and the accompanying depreciation of sterling, have been exceptional. Monetary policy cannot prevent either the necessary real adjustment as the United Kingdom moves towards its new international trading arrangements or the weaker real income growth that is likely to accompany that adjustment over the next few years. The MPC s remit specifies that, in such exceptional circumstances, the Committee must balance any trade-off between the speed at which it intends to return inflation sustainably to the target and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity. Recent developments suggest that remaining spare capacity in the economy is being absorbed a little more rapidly than expected at the time of the August Report, and that inflation remains likely to overshoot the 2% target over the next three years. All MPC members continue to judge that, if the economy follows a path broadly consistent with the August Inflation Report central projection, then monetary policy could need to be tightened by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than current market expectations. A majority of MPC members judge that, if the economy continues to follow a path consistent with the prospect of a continued erosion of slack and a gradual rise in underlying inflationary pressure then, with the further lessening in the trade-off that this would imply, some withdrawal of monetary stimulus is likely to be appropriate over the coming months in order to return inflation sustainably to target. All members agree that any prospective increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. At this month s meeting, seven members thought that the current policy stance remained appropriate to balance the demands of the MPC s remit. Two members considered it appropriate to increase Bank Rate by 25 basis points. The Committee will undertake a full assessment of recent developments in the context of its November Inflation Report and accompanying economic projections. There remain considerable risks to the outlook, which include the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal. The MPC will respond to these developments as they occur insofar as they affect the behaviour of households and businesses, and the outlook for inflation. The Committee will continue to monitor closely the incoming evidence on these and other developments, and stands ready to respond to changes in the economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target.\n",

      " UK short-term interest rates had been broadly unchanged over the period as a whole since the Committee previously met, while long-term interest rates had decreased slightly. There had been a fall in yields at the start of the period, following the publication of the August Inflation Report, with market contacts reportedly placing emphasis on the small downward revisions to near-term GDP and wage growth contained in that forecast. Over the remainder of the period, UK rates had moved broadly in line with global yields, particularly at longer maturities. The first 25 basis point rise in Bank Rate was not fully priced in by financial markets until the second half of 2018. The majority of economists responding to a survey by Reuters had expected Bank Rate to remain at 0.25% until at least the end of 2018. The ECB had left monetary policy rates and its asset purchase programme unchanged at its September meeting, confirming that the rate of asset purchases would be maintained until at least the end of the year and that it would make some decisions on the programme beyond that at its October meeting. There had been no policy meetings of the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) since the MPC had previously met. Market contacts expected an announcement on the timing of the FOMC s balance sheet normalisation programme at its September meeting. The sterling trade-weighted effective exchange rate index had depreciated by around 1% since the Committee s previous meeting. The Committee discussed various factors that may have contributed to this decline. In part, moves in sterling may have reflected developments overseas. In recent months, the reappraisal of euro-area growth prospects had pushed up the value of the euro against both the dollar and sterling. Sterling may also have been affected by domestic factors, in particular developments regarding the United Kingdom s ongoing negotiations with the European Union. The Committee noted that market expectations of the UK s future trading relationship with the EU and the transition to that relationship were likely to continue to exert a significant influence on sterling over the coming quarters. Measures of implied volatilities in equity markets had picked up, reflecting growing geopolitical tensions and US political developments. Despite these factors pushing down on global equity prices at points over the month, the level of the main international equity indices had remained broadly unchanged. Corporate bond spreads had risen over the period.\n",
      "\n",

      " Over the period since the August Inflation Report, macroeconomic data released in the United Kingdom s major trading partners had remained strong and the oil price had risen. The Committee reviewed these developments and discussed the momentum in the global economy. In the United States, quarterly GDP growth in 2017 Q2 had been revised up to 0.8% from 0.6% in the previous release that had been incorporated in the August Report. That reflected in part an upward revision to consumption growth, to 0.8%, suggesting a strong rebound from the weak reading in the first quarter. Overall, four-quarter US GDP growth had picked up to 2 %, its fastest rate for almost two years. In addition, there had generally been upside news from the high-frequency indicators for Q3, including July non-farm payrolls, retail sales and durable goods. As a result, Bank staff projected that GDP would grow by 0.7% in the third quarter, Output growth had also risen in the euro area. GDP growth in the second quarter had been confirmed at 0.6%, 0.1 percentage points weaker than expected at the time of the August Inflation Report. Four-quarter growth had nevertheless reached 2 %, its fastest rate for more than six years. In contrast to Q1, in which growth had been accounted for primarily by net trade, domestic demand had provided the largest contribution to growth in Q2. The euro area composite purchasing managers  indices for August had remained strong; taken with other indicators such as business and consumer confidence, they pointed to solid growth of 0.5% in Q3. Elsewhere, Japanese GDP had increased by 0.6% in Q2. This had mainly reflected strengthening personal consumption, and represented the fastest pace of quarterly growth for two years. In China, activity indicators had softened in July but remained at or above their 2016 averages; however, domestic demand had been supported in part by rapid credit growth, reinforcing concerns about financial stability over the medium term. Overall, UK-weighted world GDP growth in Q2 had been slightly stronger than expected at the time of the August Inflation Report. The growth of world goods trade had eased somewhat but remained consistent with healthy global demand. Looking further ahead, global GDP growth was likely to remain strong compared to recent history. The Committee noted that, in contrast to much of the period since the global financial crisis, recent and prospective GDP growth was more evenly balanced across the major economies. Taken together with the rotation of growth from consumption towards investment, this suggested that global growth prospects were better than for some time. Spot oil prices had risen by 12% in dollar terms relative to the 15-day average incorporated in the August Report. This had reflected a number of supply developments, including announcements from Saudi Arabia thought likely to promote compliance with the May OPEC agreement. There had been some volatility in oil prices arising from the disruption to production at refineries and the transportation of refined fuel in the United States following Hurricane Harvey. As a result, US gasoline futures prices and retail gasoline prices had also increased relatively sharply, which was likely to put upward pressure on overall consumer prices. US core PCE inflation had fallen slightly to 1.4% in July with the headline measure remaining at 1.4%. In the euro area, the flash estimate of core inflation had remained at 1.2% in August and headline inflation had risen to 1.5%.\n",

      " The ONS s second estimate of GDP growth in 2017 Q2 had been unrevised from the preliminary estimate, at 0.3%, in line with that assumed in the August Inflation Report. Output in the services sector had risen by 0.5%, while manufacturing and construction output had contracted over the quarter.  Within the initial breakdown of GDP by expenditure, there had been notable weakness in private final domestic demand   including both household consumption and business investment   and in the contribution of net trade to GDP growth. The Committee discussed the extent to which those components of demand might strengthen in 2017 Q3 and the implications for overall GDP growth. Household consumption was reported to have grown by only 0.1% in the second quarter, the weakest outturn since 2014 Q4 and slightly weaker than assumed in the August Inflation Report. The ONS had highlighted that a substantial part of that weakness reflected a fall in household expenditure on transport, which in turn was related to the sharp decline in new cars registered following the introduction of increased Vehicle Excise Duty on high-polluting vehicles in April. New car sales had since remained well below the levels seen earlier in the year, though they had recovered somewhat from their April lows, implying a slight boost to overall consumption growth in the third quarter. Consistent with the spending data, the Finance & Leasing Association had reported a sharp slowdown in new car finance in the second quarter. More broadly, there had been tentative signs of a modest tightening of lending criteria in the personal loan and credit card markets. In July, the twelve-month growth rate of aggregate consumer credit had fallen below 10% for the first time since April 2016. Retail sales volumes had risen further in July. Combined with the indications from more timely survey data, retail spending was likely to rise modestly over the third quarter as a whole. Bank staff s preferred measure of GfK/EC consumer confidence had fallen in August to its lowest level since the end of 2013, although that was only slightly below its long run average. Recent weakness in confidence had been driven by households becoming more pessimistic about the general economic situation and their willingness to make major purchases. Most housing market data had, in contrast, been slightly firmer. House price inflation had picked up as measured by an average of lenders  indices in August, and mortgage approvals for house purchase and HMRC property transactions had risen in July. Data from the August RICS survey had remained weak, but overall there were some signs that secondary housing market demand had strengthened somewhat. Business investment was estimated by the ONS to have been flat in 2017 Q2 on the quarter and compared with the same quarter in the previous year. That was weaker than the projection in the August Inflation Report, although official investment data were subject to significant revision over time. Bank lending to private non-financial corporations had been strong over the past few months, but that had partly been driven by a small number of M&A transactions that were unlikely to provide a strong signal about the outlook for business investment. Excluding the volatile valuables component, net trade had subtracted 0.3 percentage points from GDP growth in the initial 2017 Q2 estimate. Goods exports on that basis had risen slightly on the quarter following two quarters of robust growth, while services exports had fallen slightly. The latest monthly trade data for July had suggested an upward revision to net trade in goods, however, and goods exports excluding oil and erratics had risen by just over 4% on the month. More generally, negative contributions to growth from net trade had been recorded in all but one quarter over the past 18 months, despite the marked depreciation of sterling over that period and the relative strength of global demand. Recent survey indicators had, nevertheless, continued to suggest stronger growth in goods exports than had so far been reflected in the official data. Since the Committee s last meeting, there had been relatively little news from surveys of companies  actual and expected output. As a result, Bank staff expected preliminary GDP growth of 0.3% in 2017 Q3, in line with the projection in the August Inflation Report. Taken together, business surveys had continued to point to slightly stronger growth. Approached from the expenditure side, the Committee judged that most early indicators were consistent with a somewhat stronger profile for consumption growth in Q3 than the 0.2% rate that had been incorporated into the Inflation Report. That could potentially also suggest an upside risk to GDP growth, particularly if the contribution of net trade rose as expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen to 2.9% in August, 0.2 percentage points higher than had been expected in the Committee s latest Inflation Report projections. The twelve-month change in CPI excluding food, alcohol, tobacco and energy had increased to 2.7%, also 0.2 percentage points above expectations and the highest core rate in over five years. More generally since the Committee s last meeting, developments in the oil market suggested greater near-term upward pressure on inflation from petrol prices. Twelve-month CPI inflation was now likely to rise to above 3% in October. The latest household indicators had, nevertheless, suggested that inflation expectations had remained well anchored. The extent and timing of upward pressure on CPI inflation from import prices had been a key judgement underlying the Committee s Inflation Report projections for some time. Changes to import prices had tended to pass through only slowly to consumer prices, and the behaviour of consumer prices   especially those with high import weights   was so far broadly consistent with that pattern. Given the usual lags, further pass-through to consumer prices could be expected over time, even if import prices did not rise further. A special survey conducted by the Bank s Agents had confirmed that companies  profit margins on UK sales had been squeezed over the past 18 months relative to normal. Over the next 18 months, companies had expected that squeeze to intensify slightly. The impact of non-labour costs including import prices was, nevertheless, expected to exert less of a drag on margins looking ahead. Respondents to the survey had also reported that they expected their pricing decisions and attempts to raise productivity to boost margins to a greater degree than in the recent past. More generally, the Committee noted that companies could respond in a number of other ways to higher costs, including by reducing nominal pay growth. That made it difficult to use margins as an independent cross-check on the outlook for inflation, although the Committee would continue to monitor closely all available indicators. Recent momentum in measures of labour market quantities had persisted since the Committee s last meeting. LFS employment grew by 0.6% in the three months to July, slightly higher than expected at the time of the August Inflation Report. Indicators of employment from business surveys had continued to point to relatively strong jobs growth heading into the second half of the year.  The unemployment rate had fallen below the MPC s 4 % equilibrium estimate, to 4.3%, slightly lower than assumed in the August Inflation Report. There had, to date, been little sign of the levelling out in the unemployment rate that had been expected in a succession of recent Inflation Report projections. Indicators of recruitment difficulties had suggested that the degree of slack in the labour market was continuing to diminish. Underlying pay growth had shown some signs of recovery, albeit remaining modest. Whole-economy total average weekly earnings in the three months to July had risen by 2.1% on a year earlier, stronger than the forecast consistent with the August Inflation Report projections, although some of that reflected upside news in bonuses. Growth in whole-economy regular pay had come in weaker than expected in the August Inflation Report, but private-sector regular pay growth had been in line with expectations. Measures of regular pay growth had been around 3% on a three month on three month annualised basis, while the permanent staff salaries component of the REC Report on Jobs had risen to its highest level since the end of 2015. New data from the ONS suggested that compositional effects related to factors including the skills, industry and occupational mix of the workforce had pushed down average pay growth in the year to Q2. Empirical estimates by Bank staff suggested that these may have depressed annual growth of average weekly earnings by around 0.7 percentage points. That could also suggest upward pressure on measured growth of average wages as these effects unwound. As those compositional changes should have a similar effect on average productivity, however, the implications for unit wage costs were likely to be limited.\n",

      " The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. In pursuing that objective, the main challenges for the Committee had remained to assess the economic implications of the United Kingdom withdrawing from the European Union and to identify the appropriate policy response to that changing outlook, including to the substantial depreciation of sterling that had been associated with the decision. During the negotiation period, those economic implications would be influenced significantly by the expectations of households, firms and financial markets about the United Kingdom s eventual economic relationships with the European Union and other countries, and the transition to them.  The United Kingdom s exit from the European Union involved structural economic adjustments over which monetary policy had very little or no influence. It was nevertheless essential to take account of these evolving expectations in setting monetary policy insofar as they affected the outlook for activity and inflation. The MPC s remit specified that in such exceptional circumstances the Committee must balance any trade-off between the speed at which it intended to return inflation to the target and the support that monetary policy provided to jobs and activity. The MPC had set out its most recent assessment of the outlook for inflation and activity in the August Inflation Report. In the central projection, GDP growth remained sluggish in the near term as the squeeze on households  real income continued to weigh on consumption, before picking up over the remainder of the forecast period. Business investment and net trade had been expected to firm up, and consumption growth to recover in line with modestly rising household incomes. Conditioned on the market path for interest rates prevailing at the time of the August Report, inflation was projected to remain above the target throughout the forecast period, reflecting entirely the effects of the referendum-related falls in sterling. The August projections implied that the economy was expected to operate with a small degree of spare capacity through most of the forecast period, justifying the tolerance of some degree of above-target inflation. By the end of the forecast, however, the trade-off had been eliminated; spare capacity was expected to have been fully absorbed and inflation remained above the target. The Committee considered how the outlook, and the trade-off embodied within it, had changed since the August meeting. GDP had risen by 0.3% in the second quarter, as expected in the MPC s August projections. Although the initial breakdown of growth by expenditure component had shown notable weakness in consumption, business investment and net trade, these were early estimates that were prone to revision. Moreover, a substantial part of the weakness in household consumption in Q2 was related to a reduction in new car sales, which was expected to unwind partially in Q3.  Looking beyond Q2, retail sales volumes had risen and housing market data had also generally been slightly firmer. Taken together, the Committee judged that most early indicators were consistent with a somewhat stronger profile for consumption growth in Q3 than had been incorporated into the Inflation Report. Net trade was also expected to pick up, bolstered by the past depreciation of sterling and robust global growth. Overall, the relatively limited news on demand had pointed, if anything, to a slightly stronger picture than anticipated in the August Report. In contrast to the recent weakness of GDP growth, employment growth had been resilient. As a result, the unemployment rate had fallen to 4.3%, its lowest in over 40 years and a little lower than forecast in August. Indicators from business surveys continued to point to relatively strong jobs growth heading into the second half of the year. That might be expected to support household incomes, and hence consumption, even as increases in pay per worker remained modest. Recent activity and employment data had also pointed to weak productivity growth, corroborating the MPC s forecast for modest potential supply growth. Overall, the latest indicators had been consistent with UK demand growing a little in excess of this diminished rate of potential supply growth, and pointed to the continued erosion of the remaining limited degree of spare capacity in the economy. Underlying pay growth had shown some signs of recovery, albeit remaining modest. The sterling exchange rate had been volatile and the price of oil had increased. Headline and core CPI inflation in August had been slightly stronger than expected. Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen to 2.9% and was now expected to rise to above 3% in October. The circumstances since the referendum on EU membership, and the accompanying depreciation of sterling, had been exceptional. The MPC s remit specified that in such exceptional circumstances the Committee must balance any trade-off between the speed at which it intended to return inflation to the target and the support that monetary policy provided to jobs and activity. As slack had continued to erode, this lessened the trade-off that the MPC was required to balance and, all else equal, reduced the MPC s tolerance of above-target inflation. The Committee had noted at its last meeting that, if the economy were to follow a path broadly consistent with the August Inflation Report central projection, then monetary policy could need to be tightened by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast than the path implied by the yield curve underlying the August Report. Since then, the economic data had been broadly in line with those projections. If anything, recent developments had suggested that the remaining spare capacity in the economy was being absorbed a little more rapidly than had been expected, and that inflation remained likely to overshoot the 2% target over the next three years. For some members, these developments had further strengthened the case for an immediate tightening in monetary policy. A withdrawal of part of the stimulus that the Committee had injected in August last year would help to moderate the inflation overshoot while leaving monetary policy very supportive. Moreover, an earlier tightening of policy could mitigate the risks from a more sustained period of above-target inflationary pressure that might ultimately necessitate a more abrupt change in policy and hence a greater adjustment in growth and employment.  In any case, policy would be set at each meeting taking account of the available information; there was therefore scope to reverse any decision to marginally tighten policy should incoming developments warrant it. There were also arguments for leaving policy unchanged. The Q2 GDP data had been in line with the Committee s expectations in August, but the expenditure breakdown had appeared weak, with unanticipated weakness in consumption and business investment. Consumer confidence had also remained subdued. While there had been some signs of growing momentum in activity into the second half of the year   in particular stronger employment data, signs of a pickup in the housing market, and a partial rebound in new car sales   it was too soon to judge whether stronger consumption growth would be sufficient to offset continuing weakness in business investment. It was also unclear how sustained any increase in GDP growth might be over the medium term. And, although there had been a few more positive signs on wage growth, there was not yet evidence of the sustained pickup incorporated in the August Inflation Report projection. More generally, the Committee could undertake a full assessment of recent developments, and the data released over the next couple of months, in the context of its November forecast round. All MPC members continued to judge that, if the economy were to follow a path broadly consistent with the August Inflation Report central projection, then monetary policy could need to be tightened by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than current market expectations. A majority of MPC members judged that, if the economy continued to follow a path consistent with the prospect of a continued erosion of slack and a gradual rise in underlying inflationary pressure then, with the further lessening in the trade-off that this would imply, some withdrawal of monetary stimulus was likely to be appropriate over the coming months in order to return inflation sustainably to target. All members agreed that any prospective increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. There remained considerable risks to the outlook, which included the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal. The MPC would respond to them as they occurred insofar as they affected the behaviour of households and businesses, and the outlook for inflation. The Committee would continue to monitor closely the incoming evidence on these and other developments, and stood ready to respond to changes in the economic outlook as they unfolded to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target. The Governor invited the Committee to vote on the propositions that: Bank Rate be maintained at 0.25%; The Bank of England maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  10 billion; The Bank of England maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  435bn. Regarding Bank Rate, seven members of the Committee (the Governor, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Dave Ramsden, Andrew Haldane, Silvana Tenreyro and Gertjan Vlieghe) voted in favour of the proposition. Two members (Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders) voted against the proposition, preferring to increase Bank Rate by 25 basis points. Regarding the stock of purchased assets, the Committee voted unanimously in favour of the second and third propositions. Ben Broadbent, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy Jon Cunliffe, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability As permitted under the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended by the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016, Anthony Habgood was also present on 7 September as observer for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in his role as a member of the Bank s Court of Directors.\n",
