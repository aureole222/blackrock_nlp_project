The world economy##NewPara##The Committee considered whether the gradual improvement in the outlook for the world economy had continued over the past month.##NewPara##In the United States activity had remained robust, although consumption growth had slowed a little. The Federal Open Markets Committee had raised rates by##NewPara## basis points, accompanying this with a statement that it no longer had a bias to tighten policy. This had been interpreted by the markets as a sign that the prospect of further increases in official rates was now less immediate than they had believed before, and equity prices had reached new highs. The timing and extent of any slowdown in activity in the United States remained unclear, and it was possible that growth might stay above trend for longer than previously thought.##NewPara##Business confidence had picked up a little in Germany and France, with orders in Germany and Italy also showing some signs of recovery. While the steepening of the euro yield curve might reflect some upwards revision in views on activity, this explanation was not consistent with the recent depreciation of the euro. There was market comment that these recent movements might be explained by an increase in concerns related to the fiscal position in the euro area.##NewPara##In Japan the recorded path of output was likely to be volatile. GDP figures indicated growth of .% in the first quarter of . Adjustments to reflect a variety of factors, such as seasonal adjustment techniques, might lead to the initial estimate of growth in Q being revised down, though it might still be above most earlier forecasts. Even if such a revision were made, GDP might contract in the second##NewPara##quarter. Nevertheless base money growth continued to pick up, equity prices had risen again and business confidence was a little less weak.##NewPara##GDP forecasts compiled by Consensus Economics for the emerging market economies had generally been revised up over the last month. However, this was not so for some countries, such as Argentina, where yield spreads for government debt over US Treasuries had also increased.##NewPara##The Committee agreed that the prospects for growth in the world economy were now a little stronger than a month ago, although arguably the uncertainties in the United States had if anything increased. If growth in the United States remained strong, and if the Asian recovery gathered pace, this might begin to put pressure on non-oil commodity prices, some of which had already begun to rise, as had commodity-related currencies and equities. It was also argued that the level of world output remained below capacity and no major area except the United States was expected to grow significantly faster than its long-term trend during the coming year or two; such a persistence of spare capacity in both OECD and emerging market economies would continue to restrain global prices for the time being.##NewTopic##Monetary and financial conditions in the United Kingdom##NewPara##Growth in narrow money had risen, with notes and coin growing at their highest rate since end-. This appeared to be consistent with a pick-up in retail sales in Q. While broad money growth had eased overall, this had not been reflected in the household component. It might be that the reductions in official rates were feeding through into broad money growth for households rather faster than expected, but this was by no means certain. Total household borrowing remained robust, despite some slowing in consumer credit growth.##NewPara##Market expectations for interest rates at the shortest maturities were if anything a little lower than a month ago. However, at the two to three year horizon, interest rates implied by short-sterling futures contracts had increased by around  basis points. This might reflect a market view about the cyclical path of interest rates, particularly if market participants believed that the United Kingdom was now less likely to be part##NewPara##of Economic and Monetary Union in the near future. Alternatively, the rise in expected UK interest rates might simply reflect the fact that euro rates had risen at the same maturity; it was not clear whether such a high correlation was warranted.##NewPara##Standard variable mortgage rates had moved little over the month; there was not yet much pass-through into retail rates from last month s reduction in official rates. With the steepening in the yield curve, further increases in fixed rates on new mortgages were possible.##NewPara##The effective exchange rate index had fallen a little over the month, and was now close to the central assumption in the May Inflation Report. It was difficult to tell how much significance should be ascribed to this decline. Sterling had moved little against the euro, which accounted for two thirds of the exchange rate index, and was of considerable importance for many UK exporters. Sterling had fallen more against the dollar and was outside the range within which it had traded for some time. The question was raised of whether the significance of such a decline was fully captured by the dollar s weight in the effective index. To the extent that the linkage between sterling and the dollar had weakened, sterling s effective exchange rate might be less susceptible to future movements in the dollar against third currencies.##NewTopic##Demand and output##NewPara##While the estimate of GDP growth was unchanged for the first quarter, revisions had been made to the expenditure components. Growth in consumption was higher than had been thought earlier, and remained strong even when adjusted for a number of special factors, such as a shift in the registration date for new vehicles. The decline previously indicated for business investment had been reversed, although in overall terms investment was flat because of a steep fall in the general government component, which might reflect erratic timing factors. Final domestic demand had been revised up, and was now estimated to have grown by over % in the quarter.##NewPara##Much slower stockbuilding and a more negative contribution from net trade (reflecting higher imports) had offset these revisions, leaving the level of GDP##NewPara##unchanged. It was likely that the lower starting point for stock levels would represent a more secure base for output growth in the coming quarters.##NewPara##Retail sales volumes in the three months to May were over % higher than in the previous three months, and survey data also indicated a strengthening in activity, not only in services but also in manufacturing and construction. However, reports from the Bank s regional Agents did not suggest much of an improvement in retail conditions, with demand sluggish in many areas.##NewPara##Data from surveys and other published sources had been used to produce estimates for GDP in the second quarter, both by the National Institute for Economic Research and by Bank staff. These suggested that growth in Q could be marginally higher than in the central projection in the May Inflation Report. Such estimates were subject to error, but appeared to indicate that the recovery in output growth was on track, and that the prospects for activity were slightly better than had appeared a month ago. One complication, however, was that the annual Blue Book dataset would be published later in July, together with the full Quarterly National Accounts for Q, and might alter the measured profile of activity for recent years. But the size and direction of any revisions were not yet known.##NewPara##Indications from the housing market, reflecting data on prices, lending and transactions, all suggested a continuing recovery from the previous autumn.##NewPara##Developments in this area would require continued monitoring, although they were not yet a cause for concern.##NewPara##On balance, the Committee agreed that the news over the past month suggested that the projected recovery in activity seemed to be underway and was if anything a little faster than expected.##NewTopic##The labour market##NewPara##Data on labour market quantities were also consistent with a somewhat stronger path than had been expected for activity in Q. Employment had continued to grow, if at a slower pace, with the increase more than accounted for by full-time workers.##NewPara##Unemployment had again declined slightly, reflecting a fall in the numbers of the short-term unemployed. Despite the slowdown in GDP growth over the past year, the unemployment rate was little changed from its mid- level. Overall, labour market conditions remained somewhat tighter than had been expected, and the possibility of a substantial rise in unemployment had diminished.##NewPara##By contrast, growth in nominal earnings appeared to be slowing more than expected, with the Average Earnings Index (AEI) showing a decline in earnings growth in the private sector and in services. The fall in the twelve-month growth rate to April was particularly marked, in part reflecting a fall in bonus payments by comparison with a year ago. It would be unwise to place too much emphasis on a single month s figure for the AEI, but there were other signs of a deceleration in private sector nominal earnings, for instance in the Reward index. The Bank s matched sample of private sector settlements also showed a decline, from .% a year ago to .% in April, in contrast to the rise in public sector settlements.##NewPara##Reports from the Bank s regional Agents and the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services provided less evidence of downwards pressure on pay. Nor was there any clear downward trend in the growth of earnings on a per hour basis. In addition, one-year-ahead inflation expectations of trade unionists   as given by the Barclays Basix survey   had fallen by . percentage points over the past year, rather more than the fall in settlements, indicating that real wages were growing a little faster than a year ago. Developments in the growth of nominal and real wages therefore seemed to be rather different. An explanation might be that the effect of a change in inflation expectations on wage settlements was typically less than one-for- one in the short-term.##NewPara##The Committee noted that the National Minimum Wage had come into effect in April and had been expected to raise measures of average earnings. However, around half of those affected were thought to work in firms which were too small to be covered in the AEI sample. This increased the difficulties of assessing the impact of the minimum wage on earnings more generally. It was possible that more of the effect from the National Minimum Wage had been reflected in earnings before April than had previously been assumed.##NewPara##It was possible, however, that any deceleration in nominal earnings might prove temporary. First, during the past year, RPI inflation had fallen from over % to .%. If this was the measure on which wage bargainers focussed, rather than RPIX, it might help explain the slowdown in earnings growth. But as the impact of the reduction in interest rates began to fade, growth in RPI would become closer to that of RPIX. Second, the fall in settlements might reflect the plunge in business confidence in the autumn, when expectations of future profits had been revised down, or the sharp fall in consumer confidence, perhaps due to increasing fears of unemployment. Since then, survey data pointed to a recovery in business and consumer confidence.##NewPara##Third, lower bonus payments might reflect lower profits; if so this might reverse as the economy recovered.##NewPara##However, a temporary downward shock to inflation might persist for some time in so far as the settlements sought by wage bargainers were determined by recent inflation outturns. It was also possible that supply-side factors, such as the increasing importance of the services sector, falling union membership, and labour market reforms, might have reduced the rate of unemployment at which wage inflation would tend to increase.##NewTopic##Prices and costs##NewPara##RPIX inflation had fallen by more than expected in May, foreshadowed by the ONS advance estimate available to the Committee at its June meeting. This was largely accounted for by food prices, and to that extent the impact on prices two years ahead was unclear. That depended, in part, on whether the weakness in non-seasonal food prices was transient or reflected a trend towards a compression of retail margins. Even if the food price weakness were transient, its impact on RPIX two years out would depend on the degree of persistence of the effect of a temporary shock to inflation. In May, other goods inflation had been marginally weaker than expected##NewPara##and services inflation marginally stronger. The annual retail sales deflator had fallen in the year to May - the first fall since the series began in .##NewPara##Both oil and non-oil commodity prices were higher than a year ago and continuing to rise, and evidence from the Bank s regional Agents suggested that downwards pressure on import prices might be moderating. But imported materials prices continued to fall in May, and it was likely that some of the lagged effects of earlier declines in import prices were still to come through to retail prices.##NewPara##Figures for unit labour costs (derived from the wages, employment and output figures), when taken together with price data, suggested that margins might be coming under pressure. But margins might rise again if demand picked up. An alternative possibility was that output (and hence productivity) was higher than suggested by present estimates. In that case potential output could also be higher;  if so, there would be no implications for inflation.##NewPara##The Committee noted that, in the short term, RPIX was likely to remain below .%, but that the extent and duration of any undershoot was uncertain. It would depend on the extent to which this fed through into inflation expectations, on future movements in margins and the terms of trade, on changes in the output gap, and on how changes in productivity fed through into real wages. More generally, the outlook for prices given the prospective profile of activity was less clear than the prospects for activity itself, which seemed to be somewhat stronger than earlier expected.##NewTopic##Other issues##NewPara##The Committee noted that the analysis and projections to be carried out for the August Inflation Report would allow it to reassess some of the puzzles in the data over the next month: in particular the contrast between activity, which was somewhat stronger than expected, and prices, which were somewhat weaker.  In addition, later in July new national accounts data would be published, more information on earnings would become available, and it would be easier to assess the significance of sterling s recent movements, particularly against the dollar. While not of themselves conclusive, these were reasons for waiting another month to get a clearer picture of##NewPara##the way in which the economy was developing.##NewTopic##The immediate policy decision##NewPara##The Committee identified a variety of arguments for leaving the repo rate unchanged at %. Indicators of activity had strengthened over the past month, both in the United Kingdom and overseas. The pattern of revisions to GDP in the first quarter, with stronger final domestic demand and imports, and weaker stockbuilding, suggested stronger growth in subsequent quarters. Indications from surveys and retail sales, as well as the money and employment data, also suggested that growth in Q would be a little stronger than expected last month. However, price indicators were weaker than expected. The sharp fall in the twelve-month growth rate of the Average Earnings Index needed more corroboration, but private sector settlements also appeared to be slowing in nominal terms.  Finally, the exchange rate had eased slightly over the month, particularly against the dollar. The implication of these factors for inflation over the next two years or so would be examined through the work to be carried out for the August Inflation Report.##NewPara##Further arguments for leaving the repo rate at % were advanced. One was that given the impact of earlier interest rate reductions had yet to be fully seen, official rates should be kept at % until evidence emerged of price pressures in either direction. A second was that rates were now close to their neutral level, and that this was appropriate given the state of the economic cycle and the evidence on employment. A third argument was that against a background with a significant probability for inflation to undershoot the target in the short term, the Committee might be able to wait and see whether some of the developments, for instance in the labour market, as was looking increasingly likely, reflected structural changes in the economy.##NewPara##On another view, it might have been preferable last month to have left the repo rate unchanged for the reasons set out at the time. Developments over the month had probably strengthened that argument. Although cost increases were lower than expected, other indicators, such as domestic demand, money data and housing market activity, were pointing to a less benign inflation outlook further ahead, and the##NewPara##exchange rate was back in line with the central assumption in the May Inflation Report. But there were two reasons for not reversing last month s reduction. First, to do so might affect business and consumer confidence disproportionately. A reduction followed by an immediate rise in interest rates, in the absence of significant news about the economy, did not necessarily have the same impact on confidence as a constant level of rates. Second, a reversal might wrongly be interpreted as a stronger signal of the future path of interest rates than was warranted. It was desirable, therefore, to leave the repo rate unchanged this month.##NewPara##The Governor invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank s repo rate be maintained at .%. The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the proposition.
