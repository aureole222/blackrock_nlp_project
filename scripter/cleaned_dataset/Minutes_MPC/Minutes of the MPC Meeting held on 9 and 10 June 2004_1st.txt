Oil prices##NewPara##Oil prices had risen sharply during , and the Committee discussed the possible implications for the global economy and for the United Kingdom. Since the beginning of , the spot price of Brent crude oil had risen by some % in dollar terms. Oil futures prices had also risen. However, the spot price had fallen by around % in dollar terms, and % in sterling terms, since the Committee s May meeting, in part because of the decision by OPEC to raise official quotas.##NewPara##Several factors had contributed to the rise in oil prices during , and it was important to distinguish between those which might be transitory and those which were more likely to be associated with a rise in the price which could be sustained in the longer term. Among the shorter-term influences, first, demand had risen, reflecting the cyclical recovery in the global economy; second, there was at present only a limited amount of additional capacity which could be brought into production quickly in response to a rise in prices; third, stocks had been low in some oil-consuming countries, which had been looking to rebuild them; and, fourth, perceived geopolitical risks to the supply of oil had probably increased. There had also been an underlying increase in demand in countries where production was energy-intensive, notably China, which implied some pressure on available capacity. More generally, the equilibrium price would depend on the cost of opening up new non-OPEC sources of supply. Although it seemed likely that oil prices would fall back from their present level in the longer term, the more immediate prospects were uncertain, and there might be limits to the ability of OPEC to vary the supply of oil in response to price movements.##NewPara##A rise in oil prices could influence the UK economy through various channels. First, there was an initial upward impact on the current rate of inflation. Second, there was likely to be an adverse effect on domestic demand and activity. That would tend to bear down on inflation further forward.##NewPara##Third, there would also be effects on global inflation and activity, in turn affecting the cost of imports and the strength of external demand for UK goods. Finally, there could be second-round effects on UK earnings and prices.##NewPara##The overall impact on the United Kingdom of the oil price rises seen so far this year was therefore uncertain, but was likely in aggregate to be modest. In real terms, the price of oil was less than half of its high levels in the late s and early s. The intensity with which oil was used in production had fallen in the United Kingdom over time, and the increase in labour market flexibility and better-anchored inflation expectations mitigated the risk of second-round effects. But there could be more pronounced effects on particular sectors of the economy, and on those countries where the oil intensity of production was higher.##NewTopic##Financial markets##NewPara##Short-term interest rates had risen in the major economies since the Committee s May meeting, probably reflecting both stronger economic data and the perception that higher oil prices might lead to higher interest rates. UK interest rates six months forward had risen by some  basis points, compared with rises of around  basis points in the United States but only around  basis points in the euro area. The greater increase in the United Kingdom appeared to be a response both to stronger data and to the May Inflation Report and Minutes.##NewPara##Longer-term nominal spot interest rates had risen modestly over the past month in the United Kingdom, the United States and the euro area. But this primarily reflected developments at the short end. Longer-term nominal forward rates had been relatively little changed in these markets over the past month, although taking the past three months together there had been a material rise in US forward rates.##NewPara##There had been contrasting movements in the inflation expectations which could be inferred from financial markets. In the United Kingdom, implied CPI inflation expectations appeared to have risen materially only at the short end, perhaps reflecting the Committee s Inflation Report projections. But in the United States and the euro area, the apparent rise in implied inflation expectations had also taken place at longer maturities. In the United States, the rise had been associated with an increase in the##NewPara##current rate of inflation. There had been little rise in real interest rates in the United States.##NewPara##The sterling effective exchange rate index had risen by over % since the Committee s May meeting. This could in part be explained by the recent rise in short-term interest differentials in favour of sterling.##NewPara##Equity price movements in the major economies had generally been modest in the past month in local currency terms.##NewTopic##The international economy##NewPara##The balance of news from the world economy over the past month had been positive overall, particularly when taking account of the pattern of UK trade, and the global recovery now appeared to be more broadly based.##NewPara##It was estimated that euro-area GDP had increased by .% in  Q. This was stronger than the Committee had expected at the time of the May Inflation Report projections. There had been a strong positive contribution, of . percentage points, from net trade, which implied that the stimulus to external demand from the global recovery had outweighed the influence of the appreciation of the euro during . Euro-area net trade performance had been volatile quarter-to-quarter during , so it was too early to be confident that the recovery would be sustained at a more rapid rate than expected, but this was welcome evidence.##NewPara##There was mixed news about the strength of euro-area domestic demand. Investment had fallen in  Q, but that may have reflected the unwinding of earlier temporary strength in German investment. Consumption had grown by .% in Q, with healthier growth in France but a relatively weak performance in Germany. A key issue was whether euro-area consumption would continue to grow at this stronger rate. It was, for example, possible that household spending in Germany might remain weak, if it was linked to uncertainty about the impact of structural reform. Early indicators for  Q were encouraging: euro-area retail sales had risen by .% on the month in April, with some growth in Germany. However, euro-area consumer confidence had eased in May. Surveys of euro- area output also pointed to continued healthy growth in Q, broadly in line with the recovery##NewPara##The flash estimate for euro-area HICP inflation in May showed a rise from .% to .%. That probably reflected rising petrol prices, by comparison with particularly low energy prices twelve months earlier, and the impact of higher administered prices. An important question was whether these temporary influences on inflation would prompt higher wage increases.##NewPara##The US economy had strengthened. The estimate of GDP growth in Q had been revised up slightly, to .%, and the strength of nominal demand was consistent with the pickup in broad money growth since the turn of the year. It was particularly significant that the non-farm payrolls data for April and May, which had both been published since the Committee s May meeting, showed strong increases in employment: there had been a rise of nearly one million in payrolls in the past three months. That might underpin household spending, although the latest indicators were mixed, with consumption growth easing slightly in April and consumer confidence flat or falling in May. The output indicators pointed to continuing strong growth in Q. The output gap had probably narrowed: capacity utilisation was at its highest level since mid-, and inflationary pressures were increasing, both on the core and headline measures of consumer prices. This had contributed to a widespread market expectation that US interest rates would soon begin to rise.##NewPara##The recovery in Japan had continued. GDP growth in  Q, at .%, was more rapid than had been envisaged at the time of the Inflation Report, and represented the fastest growth among the G economies. Consumption growth in Q was strong in both real and nominal terms; the upward trend in nominal growth was welcome, since it opened the prospect of an end to deflation. Strong growth of industrial production and buoyant indicators of consumer spending in April suggested a continued healthy growth performance in Q.##NewPara##GDP growth in China continued to be rapid. There were some risks to this performance, both from rising inflation and possible problems in the banking sector. But medium-term prospects still looked strong.##NewTopic##Money, credit, demand and output##NewPara##In the United Kingdom, output and demand growth appeared to have continued at around or above trend so far in , but there remained some tension between the official data for output growth and the more buoyant evidence from surveys.##NewPara##Aggregate broad money growth had eased a little in April, but lending growth continued to be very strong. The monetary data were consistent with steady growth in aggregate nominal demand.##NewPara##The ONS estimated GDP growth in  Q to have been .%, unchanged from the previous release. The service sector was estimated to have continued to grow strongly in Q. In contrast, manufacturing sector output had been estimated to have contracted by .%, although that had been revised to a fall of .% in the Index of Production release for April. However, the survey data had pointed to more buoyant manufacturing activity in Q. And the ONS had reported a rise in manufacturing output of .% in April, which suggested that the apparent weakness in Q could be temporary or erratic. Survey evidence pointed to gathering strength. The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) had reported increased activity and new orders balances for manufacturing in May. A special survey by the Bank s regional Agents suggested that manufacturing output had increased in Q and would pick up further in Q. Surveys by the EEF and the CBI reinforced this picture. The CIPS services activity and new orders balances had both eased slightly in May but still pointed to robust growth.##NewPara##Consumption was estimated to have grown by .% in Q. Retail sales growth in the same period had suggested an even stronger performance. Aggregate investment growth had been weaker than expected: investment in the services and manufacturing sectors had been robust, but there had been a large negative contribution from the construction sector. Nominal government consumption was stronger than expected in Q. Net trade was unusually weak, making a negative contribution of##NewPara##. percentage points. The weakness of exports, in particular, had been surprising, against the background of strengthening global recovery in Q, since it was unlikely that the rise in sterling since the beginning of the year could have had an impact so quickly. However, goods exports were reported to have grown by .% in April, so it was possible that the weakness of exports in Q might prove to be temporary. Changes to reporting methods meant that there were particular uncertainties relating to##NewPara##the profile of export growth at present.##NewPara##Evidence on the pace of household sector spending in  Q was mixed. Retail sales had increased by only .% in April, and private car registrations in both April and May had been lower than a year earlier. The annual growth rate of unsecured lending to individuals had eased again in April, although at % it remained very strong relative to nominal demand. It was possible that the easing was explained by the substitution by ho useholds of secured borrowing at lower interest rates. Other indicators suggested continuing robust growth in consumption. The CBI Distributive Trades survey and the British Retail Consortium survey had both pointed to stronger growth in May.##NewPara##Indicators from the housing market suggested that house price inflation had picked up further, and so was likely to be even stronger in  Q than the Committee had expected at the time of the Inflation Report. The average of the Nationwide and Halifax house price indices had increased by .% in the three months to May, a rise of . percentage points from April. But there were a few tentative signs that activity might be easing. A preview of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) survey for May pointed to a sharp decline in the balance expecting house price increases in the next three months, and the ratio of sales to unsold stocks suggested that the market had loosened slightly in April and May. The number of housing loan approvals, although still high, had fallen a little from its peak at the end of . The annual rate of secured lending growth had increased in April to .%, but past rises in house prices meant that the rate of secured lending growth was likely to remain high for some time even if inflation soon began to ease. There were also some anecdotal reports that houses were becoming harder to sell. But these indicators of easing activity were very tentative, and it was clear that any slowdown in house price inflation would be later and from a higher rate than the Committee had previously envisaged.##NewTopic##The labour market, costs and prices##NewPara##Evidence from both labour market quantities and prices suggested that conditions were tightening gradually, consistent with the May Inflation Report projections.##NewPara##According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), the employment rate had risen by . percentage points in Q, to .%, and average hours had also increased. On average, employment had increased by about , a quarter over the past two quarters, whereas an average rise of only around , a##NewPara##quarter was needed to maintain the employment rate. The unemployment rate on the LFS measure had fallen to .%, the lowest rate since the mid-s. Both survey evidence and contacts of the Bank s regional Agents had suggested that there were wide-ranging labour shortages and that employment was expected to increase further.##NewPara##Overall earnings growth increased by . percentage points to .% in  Q, reflecting an exceptional contribution from bonuses in January. Regular pay growth in the private sector had increased by . percentage points to .%. Taking account of hours worked, the rate of increase of whole economy earnings was .%. Private sector settlements were increasing slowly.##NewPara##There might now be an upside risk to the Committee s projections for employment. If that materialised, the effect on inflation would depend on where the rate of unemployment consistent with stable inflation now stood, and on the strength of immigration. In a longer-term perspective, it remained surprising that pay had not increased more rapidly in response to the tightening in the labour market. That might partly reflect labour market flexibility, changes to patterns of remuneration and perhaps also the weakness of demand for labour elsewhere in Europe, which had helped to encourage immigration to the United Kingdom.##NewPara##CPI inflation had risen by . percentage point to .% in April. In line with pre-release arrangements, an advance estimate of CPI inflation in May was provided to the Governor   days ahead of publication, and this suggested a rise of . percentage points to .%. The latest news on oil prices was likely to add moderately to inflation in the near term, but the effect of this would be roughly offset by weaker-than-expected prices for a range of miscellaneous services, including financial services. It was likely that inflation would rise over the next month or so, but that it would remain below target.##NewPara##ONS data suggested that, despite rises in the price of oil, steel, and some other materials, supply chain pressures were relatively subdued. But evidence from the Bank s Agents on manufacturers  input prices suggested a pickup, and the CIPS manufacturing survey showed a sharp rise in input prices in May, to the highest level since mid-. The Agents reported that so far there were few signs that higher pay and input costs were being reflected in higher output prices. However, the CIPS manufacturing and services surveys suggested that output prices were rising, although less rapidly than input prices. The Committee noted the possibility that since higher oil and commodity prices would##NewPara##affect both domestic and foreign competitors, they might eventually be passed through to consumers rather than being absorbed in profit margins.##NewTopic##Other considerations##NewPara##More than half the economists surveyed by Reuters expected a rise of  basis points in the repo rate at the June meeting; the survey showed an average probability of % attached to a  basis point increase, and a % chance of a  basis point increase. Since the survey was taken, other indicators of market sentiment had pointed to an increase in the perceived probability of a repo rate rise, and both anecdotal evidence and the pattern of very short-term interest rates suggested that this probability might be around -%. Market participants generally believed that there would be a repo rate increase in July if there were not one in June. Following the information published by the Committee during May, market participants would now see a further repo rate rise before the August Inflation Report round as consistent with the Bank s reaction function.##NewTopic##The immediate policy decision##NewPara##The balance of news on the month suggested stronger external demand and inflation, particularly in UK-weighted terms. Euro-area growth had strengthened, while the recoveries in the United States and Asia were well established. Oil prices had risen sharply so far in , but the impact on the UK economy looked likely to be modest. Short-term interest rates had risen by more in the United Kingdom than elsewhere in May, which helped account for a rise of over % in sterling. ONS estimates of GDP growth had been less than expected in Q given the survey evidence, but indicators of output growth so far in Q had been robust. There was mixed evidence on the strength of household spending, and, while house price inflation was stronger than the Committee had envisaged in May, there were tentative indicators that housing market activity might be easing. Labour market conditions were tightening, in terms of both employment and earnings. The near-term outlook for CPI inflation was little changed; a pickup was expected but inflation was likely to remain below the target in the next few months.##NewPara##Against this background, the Committee agreed that there were several arguments for a rise of  basis points in the repo rate this month. First, for most members, the May Inflation Report projections could have warranted a rise of  basis points at that time. That would have helped to reduce the risk##NewPara##that inflationary pressures would gather momentum. An important argument against such a step in May had been the risk at that time that it might have been mistaken for a change in the Bank s  strategy, especially since CPI inflation remained well below target. Since then, the Committee had had the opportunity to explain the change in the economic outlook in the May Inflation Report and the Minutes of its May meeting so that a further repo rate increase would now be understood as a response to this more robust outlook. For one member, however, the May Inflation Report projections would not have warranted a rise of  basis points at that time. Those projections did not suggest a need to raise rates more rapidly than the market had expected, given that inflation was not expected to exceed the target until close to the two-year horizon, when growth had returned to trend. Nevertheless, in the view of that member, a repo rate rise in June was consistent with the path of rates which conditioned the market rate projection published in May. Second, the balance of risks had moved towards the upside, given the tightening in the labour market and the more broadly based world recovery. Inflation expectations derived from financial markets also appeared to have risen a little. It was important that monetary policy responded so as to ensure that inflation expectations remained in line with the target. Third, for some members, the need for a repo rate increase was reinforced by the prospect of higher domestic debt service levels and personal income gearing. Household debt continued to rise rapidly and to outstrip earnings growth. A further increase in interest rates now might encourage a more prudent approach towards incurring higher levels of prospective debt servicing, so helping to contain the vulnerability of demand to subsequent shocks.##NewPara##The Committee considered possible arguments for keeping rates unchanged. First, the Q UK National Accounts and  Blue Book data would be published at the end of June. Second, there were some possible downside risks to the outlook. The three earlier repo rate increases had not yet taken their full effect. The past rise in oil prices might dampen sentiment both at home and abroad, and there were also geopolitical risks to confidence. Consumer confidence, the housing market and the manufacturing sector could all turn out to be more fragile than the Committee currently believed.##NewPara##Taking these arguments to gether, the Committee favoured an immediate repo rate increase of  basis points. For one member, the decision was finely balanced.##NewPara##The Governor invited members to vote on the proposition that the repo rate should be increased by  basis points to .%. The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the proposition.
