Judging the extent of spare capacity in the economy is one of the key tasks in setting interest rates to hit an inflation target. As a general rule, the less spare capacity, the more inflationary pressure. ###newline### Estimates of spare capacity in the UK in  by different forecasting groups vary substantially. At one extreme, the OECD thinks there is less spare capacity in  than in the boom years of -. By contrast, HM Treasury sees much more spare capacity in  than in - and, indeed, more than the average during -. ###newline### The results presented here suggest the following. First, capacity utilisation data provided by firms indicate slightly more spare capacity in  than in - and considerably less than in -. ###newline### Second, within the labour market, there is more evidence of spare capacity in . Indeed, the data suggest that in , spare capacity is greater, on average, than the whole period -. Wage inflation and labour cost data are broadly consistent with this picture. ###newline### Overall, my impression is that the amount of spare capacity in the UK available in  (and indeed today) is slightly greater than in -, not very different from that in - and slightly less than in -. This suggests more spare capacity than the OECD numbers indicate but less than the Treasury figures. On balance, there still appears to be some spare capacity available in the labour market, but within firms the overall situation is tight. Finally, it is plain from the data that the amount of spare capacity available is significantly greater than in the boom of the late s. ###newline### The amount of spare capacity in an economy is the difference between potential output and actual output, where potential output is the amount which can be produced given the existing capital stock using the equilibrium number of employees working for equilibrium hours at the equilibrium level of intensity. Without going into unnecessary detail, one may think of the equilibrium levels of labour inputs as those consistent with stable inflation. Consequently, if actual output exceeds potential output, there is no spare capacity and we may expect inflation to be rising. So the extent of spare capacity in an economy is a key variable when setting short-term interest rates to hit an inflation target. ###newline### Many forecasting groups produce inverse measures of spare capacity which they term the output gap (actual output less potential output). In Figure , we show a number of different measures of the output gap. What is plain is that, currently, there is a wide variety of estimates of the level of the output gap. To see more precise numerical estimates, we set out some averages in Table . What we find is that at one extreme, HM Treasury sees the UK economy in  as having at least as much spare capacity as in the previous three years, on average, and very much more than in either of the periods - or -. By contrast, the OECD estimates that there is no available spare capacity in , with more spare capacity available in - and much more in -. The other forecasters lie between these two extremes. ###newline### The measures of the output gap seen in Figure  differ because the teams use different methods, particularly in the treatment of the public sector, and have different estimates of equilibrium employment, hours etc. Our purpose here is not to try and construct yet another measure of the output gap but to see what light other published data can shed on this issue. The first data series which we consider refer to capacity utilisation, where firms are asked questions of the form  Are you operating at full capacity?  or  Is system capacity likely to limit your ability to increase business over the next  months? . A problem here is that the notion of full capacity is not well defined. It seems reasonable to suppose that a manufacturing firm is operating at full capacity if it is using its capital stock at the normal maximum level of operation. The same would also apply to a service firm like a restaurant. An accountancy firm ###newline### would, however, probably say it was operating at full capacity if all the professionals within the firm were busy. It is obvious from these examples that working at full capacity does not refer to the production of the absolute maximum level of output. ###newline### However, data on capacity utilisation does tell us something about the extent of spare capacity within firms given the existing levels of physical or human capital employed. ###newline### Spare capacity in the economy, however, also exists if there are individuals who are not currently employed who are willing and able to assist in the expansion of existing capacity by, for example, manning an extra shift or increasing the number of professionals in a business services company. This leads on to the second group of data series we consider, namely those which capture the extent of spare resources in the labour market. In particular we look both at pure labour market data, such as the unemployment rate, and at data capturing firms  views on the extent of spare capacity in the labour market. ###newline### Finally, the third type of data series we consider refers to the direct inflationary consequences of both labour market tightness and high levels of excess demand facing firms. We then finish with our overall conclusions on the current level of spare capacity in the UK. ###newline### Information on capacity utilisation in manufacturing (.% of the private sector) is available from CBI (Confederation of British Industry) surveys, and these are set out in Fig.. We have three capacity related questions. The first, in Fig.a, reveals the proportion of firms which are currently operating at full capacity. In Fig.b, we see the proportion of firms where (shortage of) plant capacity is expected to limit output over the next three months and in Fig.c we have the proportion of firms where (shortage of) capacity is a reason for capital expenditure over the next twelve months. The overall picture is one where the  level of capacity utilisation is close to that in -, above that in - but below that in - and well below that in the late s boom. ###newline### Turning to the service sector (.% of the private sector), the main overall measure of capacity utilisation is that reported by BCC (British Chambers of Commerce), presented in Fig.. On this measure, capacity utilisation in the service sector in  is a little above that in - and above that in - and -. The CBI produces data on the service sector which gives a slightly different impression. ###newline### Services are divided into three sub-sectors, business services (% of services), consumer services (% of services) and financial services (% of services). The data series presented in Figs.a, a, a, refer to the proportion of firms whose level of business is above normal and those in Figs.b, b, b, capture the proportion of firms where system capacity is likely to limit the level of business over the next  months. The overall picture here suggests that the  level of capacity utilisation is, on balance, below that in -, which contrasts with the BCC series. ###newline### In order to help us obtain a complete picture, we present a summary table of all the series (Table ). The overall impression is that capacity utilisation within firms in  is a little below that in - but well above -. Looking at the first four rows, it is clear that capacity utilisation in - is only a little below that in . Finally, it is plain that manufacturing sector capacity utilisation was far higher in the late s boom than in any recent period. ###newline### One way for a firm to raise its output without increasing its capital stock or employing more people is to raise weekly hours. Average weekly working hours have been falling steadily since the th century, essentially because as individuals become richer, they choose to take more of their time in the form of leisure. Over the last ten years, average weekly hours worked in the private sector have still been falling in part as a continuation of the long-term trend increase in the demand for leisure, in part as a consequence of the EC Working Time Directive and, more recently, as a response to the cyclical weakness in -. In recent months, average weekly hours have started to rise (see Fig.). This turn round may simply reflect a temporary blip in the secular downward trend. On the other hand, it may represent the start of a cyclical upturn leading to a more permanent increase in normal working hours. ###newline### Which of these is correct has important implications for the extent of spare capacity. In the latter case, firms could expand output significantly without hiring any more employees. In the former case, when weekly hours fall back to their normal levels, firms would have to raise employment significantly in order to sustain output levels. It is hard to say which of these is correct although the fact that there is no apparent increase in weekly pay corresponding to the rise in weekly hours may suggest a degree of measurement error in the latter series. ###newline### These overall labour market ratios are not wholly reliable as indicators of labour market slack in part because structural changes in the labour market have raised effective labour supply in recent years (see, for example, Nickell and Quintini, ). And this is a continuing process with the various New Deal programs and in-work benefits (tax credits) still raising the effective supply of labour, albeit slowly. ###newline### Looking at the extent of labour market slack from the point-of-view of firms, we have a number of relevant series in both manufacturing and service sectors. In manufacturing, we present in Figs.a, b the CBI series giving the proportion of firms where one of the factors limiting output over the next three months is a shortage of skilled labour and the BCC series on the proportion of firms suffering from recruitment difficulties. Both series give the same impression of more labour market slack in  than in - and the first reveals much more slack than in the late s boom. In the services sector, we show the BCC series on recruitment difficulties (Fig.) and three CBI series on the proportion of firms where the availability of professional staff is likely to limit the level of business over the next  months (Figs.a, b, c). The overall picture suggests again that there is more labour market slack in  than in -. ###newline### To arrive at an overview, we present a summary table of all the series (Table ). The overall picture is one in which the labour market tightness in  is somewhat lower than in recent years, being well down on - and a little down on -. This contrasts with the degree of capacity utilisation within firms in  which is well up on - ###newline### If there is no spare capacity in a market and demand continues to rise, then prices in that market will tend to accelerate, rising relative to costs. So, in circumstances where it is hard to detect the levels of spare capacity directly, it may be useful to look at what is happening to prices. Of course, there may be other reasons why prices accelerate or rise relative to costs, for example, falls in the level of competition in the market, so this sort of evidence can never be decisive. But it may nevertheless be helpful to see whether it is consistent with the quantity evidence. ###newline### Starting with the labour market, we see in Fig. that underlying annual earnings growth in the private sector has been rising since mid- at roughly the same average rate as it rose during  and . However, the rate of increase has slowed in the second half of . Indeed, if we look at the three-month-on-three- month rate, this had been flat for nearly a year. Turning to the unit labour costs faced ###newline### by companies, as opposed to pay, we see from Fig. that this has been trending downwards in recent years, essentially because private sector productivity growth has been outpacing private sector pay growth over this period. Overall, this evidence is consistent with the view that labour market tightness has not significantly worsened since . ###newline### Turning to product market prices, first we look at the pattern of price inflation and second we consider the key issue, that is whether or not output price inflation has been higher than unit cost inflation, since this would be a typical consequence of excess demand. Output price inflation exceeding unit cost inflation is equivalent to rising profit margins, so we look at profit margins in various sectors. ###newline### A broad picture of domestic output price inflation is provided in Fig., where we present domestic goods price inflation (excluding petroleum products) in Fig.a and CPI service price inflation in Fig.b. Goods price inflation started rising in  and continued rising until . However, since mid-, the inflation rate has stopped rising, flattening off at around %, despite cost inflation continuing to rise (driven by commodity prices). CPI service price inflation started rising in  and continued to rise for nearly three years before falling back. Recently, however, it has gradually begun to increase again mainly because package holiday prices were unusually weak in . ###newline### Turning to profit margins, in Fig. we present two measures, one based on the Annual Business Inquiry (ABI), the other on National Accounts (NA) data. In Fig. a), c), we present estimates of average profit margins in manufacturing from . ###newline### The overall picture is one of declining margins from  to . Then, the ABI data suggest some recovery of margins in  and . However, the NA data suggest a continuing slow decline in margins right up until . As yet, we do not clearly understand this discrepancy. (The ONS indicates that the ABI numbers for  are probably better. However, the Datastream estimates of manufacturing margins for quoted companies look more like the NA data.) ###newline### The data are more consistent in the service sector, where both the series in Figs. b), ###newline### d) indicate declines in service sector margins around the turn of the century then stability in recent years. There is no evidence of any increase in margins in  in the NA data. ###newline### Overall, the data suggest that margins have been relatively stable recently, whereas they were generally falling around the turn of the century. In the manufacturing sector, falling margins from  were only to be expected following the huge rise in the Sterling exchange rate during -. This would have vastly increased the competitiveness of foreign companies leading to strong pressure on the margins of home companies which would have masked any excess demand effects in -. Quite why service sector margins were falling for several years after  is not clear because all the other data suggest that demand was particularly strong in ###newline### The general picture from the within firm data is that there is slightly more spare capacity in  than during the previous peak in - with slightly less capacity than in the late s and considerably less than in -. Within the labour market there is more evidence of spare capacity in , the data suggesting that in , spare capacity is greater, on average, than over the whole period - although a little less than -. The wage inflation and labour cost data are broadly consistent with this picture. However, the price and margins data are more difficult to interpret although there is no strong evidence of either accelerating prices or rising margins in . ###newline### So what does this all add up to? The overall impression is that the amount of spare capacity available in  is greater than in -, not very different from that in - and slightly less than in -. This is at variance with the OECD numbers in Table , where there is less spare capacity in  than in any other period. It is also at variance with the HMT numbers, where there is more spare capacity in  than in any other period. On balance, there still appears to be some spare capacity available in the labour market, but within firms the overall situation is ###newline### relatively tight. It is plain, however, that the amount of capacity available is significantly greater than in the boom of the late s. ###newline### When estimating the output gap, the OECD correctly focuses on the private sector. The other forecasters tend to operate in the context of the whole economy including the government sector. ###newline### It is worth noting that apparently small changes in average weekly hours generate significant changes in overall GDP. Thus an increase of half an hour in average weekly hours corresponds to a   % rise in GDP. ###newline### The groups are short-term unemployed (<m), long-term unemployment (>m), students, temporarily sick, discouraged, caring for family, long-term sick, retired, other. ###newline### So if prices are rising relative to unit costs, then the profit margin is rising.
