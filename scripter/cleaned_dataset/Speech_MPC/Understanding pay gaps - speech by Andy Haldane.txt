Data for  published earlier this year shows a gender pay gap of around % across reporting UK organisations. The UK government has also begun a consultation on requiring companies to publish ethnicity pay gaps on an annual basis. While % of employers monitor ethnicity pay gaps, only % of employers currently publish them. The Bank of England has published data on its gender pay gap since  and on its ethnicity pay gap since . While it is widely recognised that these pay gap measures may be imperfect proxies for pay inequality, greater transparency about pay gaps can serve as an important incentive device. Publishing companies  pay gaps encourages them to explain and, with time, close these gaps. The benefits of doing so, for individual companies and the economy at large, have been found to be large.  For example, closing the gender pay gap has been estimated to add   billion (or % of GDP) to UK GDP by  (McKinsey ()), while full representation of BAME individuals across the labour market, through improved participation and progression, could add an additional   billion (or over % of GDP) per year (BEIS ()). Internationally, similar moves to improve pay gap reporting are underway. Iceland has since January  required external auditors to assess pay inequalities among companies with more than  employees., The Danish Equal Pay Act  requires companies with a minimum of  employees to make available gender-disaggregated pay statistics. A number of other EU member states have implemented new reporting standards, including recently in Germany and France. In the US, all employers with more than  workers must disclose pay information to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In this paper, we provide a detailed empirical examination of gender and ethnicity pay gaps in the UK using micro-level survey data. As well as describing the evolution of these pay gaps over time, we identify some of the key explanations and drivers of them over time. This decomposition is important when accurately interpreting data on pay gaps and when deciding where action might best be taken   by companies and/or public policymakers   to close these gaps and harvest some of the benefits this would bring. ###newline###  Gender and ethnicity pay gaps have been studied fairly extensively using US data. In the US, the female/male earnings ratio has increased steadily since the s (Blau and Kahn ()). This is typically attributed to improvements in women s levels of education and experience (Stanley and Jarrell (), Jarrell and Stanley (), Weichselbaumer and Winter-Ebmer ()). Alkadry and Tower () find human capital explains over % of the gender pay gap. Some studies have also found occupational representation and segregation has been a factor explaining gender pay gaps (Lewis and Soo Oh ()). Goldin () provides one of the most comprehensive studies of the gender pay gap in the US across different age groups.  She finds that, while the gap has narrowed for most age groups, the aggregate gap has remained fairly stable. By looking across the life-cycle, she finds that as workers get older the size of the gender pay gap tends to rise. It also differs significantly by occupation, with business occupations having the largest gender pay gaps and technology and science-related occupations the lowest. Like others, Goldin finds that the narrowing of the gap across age groups is largely due to a rise in the human capital of women relative to men, due to factors such as improved levels of education, experience, and labour force participation. The remaining pay difference can partly be explained by higher-paying occupations in the corporate, financial and legal worlds, especially at later career stages. This is disadvantageous for women who are more likely to work part-time or work fewer hours due to raising children. The US literature on ethnic minority pay has tended to focus on wage differentials between white and black ethnic groups, the two largest ethnic groups in the US. Studies have tended to find a large wage differential between black and white men, although this does appear to have reduced over time with the black/white earnings ratio increasing from just under % in  to around % by  (Lang and Lehmann ()). This broadly mirrors trends in the gender pay gap. Studies looking at wage gaps over the life-cycle find that there is little evidence of an ethnicity pay gap during early working life, but that this grows to around % by age  (Tomaskovic-Devey et al ()). Evidence on the role of education on the size of the ethnicity pay gap is mixed. Some studies find that, among young men, the black/white pay differential appears, in part, to be explained by education (O Neill (), Rodgers and Spriggs () and Carneiro, Heckman, and Masterov ()). For example, the pay differential decreases when controlling for performance on the Armed Forces Qualifying Test (Neal and Johnson ()). Studies also find that, among college-educated men, there is no difference in pay between black and white males (Black et al ()). This might suggest the ethnicity pay gap can largely be explained by human capital differences in white-collar sectors, but not in blue-collar jobs (Bjerk ()). Other studies, however, have found that human capital differences increase the pay differential (Lang and Manove ()). Wage differentials between black and white women have historically been considerably lower than between men (Lang ()) and at times have even reversed. However, Neal () demonstrates that this finding partially reflects the differential selection of black and white women into the labour force. For example, black women face a lower household income than white women, which provides a stronger incentive for them to enter the workforce in the first place. For the UK, although evidence is more partial, it suggests that both gender and ethnicity pay gaps have fallen over time (ONS (), ONS ()). For gender, the factors determining these gaps include age, educational background, sector, occupation and part time work (Olsen and Walby (), Manning and Swaffield (), Brynin (), ONS ()). For ethnicity, it includes occupation, being born in the UK and education (ONS (), Brynin and Guveli ()). As in the US, the UK ethnicity gap appears to be larger for males than females (Longhi and Brynin ()). When it comes to explaining the sources of pay gaps, three main approaches have typically been used. Regression techniques estimate pay gaps controlling for various characteristics of the individual or job (Goldin (), Brynin and Guveli ()). Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions account for differences in pay between two groups using an independent set of factors. This is useful for capturing the effects of compositional differences in the characteristics of groups (O Donnell et al ()). Finally, a rich literature uses experiments to assess bias in hiring, promotion and bargaining between groups (Neumark ()). In this paper, we use the first two approaches   regression-based techniques and decompositions   to analyse gender and ethnicity pay gaps in the UK. In the next section, we describe the dataset, summarise key trends in the UK labour market over the past  years and discuss unconditional pay gaps by gender and ethnicity. In the following section, we provide an explanation of these pay gaps using factor- decomposition and regression-based methods. Section  summarises our key findings and policy recommendations. ###newline###  This paper uses quarterly returns from the UK Labour Force Survey (LFS) from  Q to  Q. This gives us a sample of ,, observations of employed individuals, reduced to , observations when incorporating pay variables, as there are fewer observations for respondents on pay. There are two main advantages to using the LFS relative to other surveys, such as the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE). First, the LFS has the longest time-series of pay and other work characteristics at a quarterly frequency in the UK.  Using it allows us to track the evolution of pay gaps over time.  Second, the LFS dataset offers a rich set of information on the characteristics of both workers and their jobs. These controls improve the robustness of the analysis, statistically, and the ability to explain movements in pay gaps behaviourally, using various individual and work-related characteristics. There have been a number of important changes in the employed LFS survey population over time. First, the share of ethnic minorities in the workforce has more than doubled, from % in  to % in . Second, the share of the population in higher education or with a degree has also increased significantly, from % to %. Third, the share of the population not born in the UK has almost tripled, from % in  to % in . These trends are representative of the composition of the UK population, as reported in the  Census. Female participation in the workforce has been on a broadly upward trend in the UK. Elsewhere across the G, trends have been more disparate (Chart ). Based on OECD Labour Force Statistics, UK rates of female participation are second only to Canada across the G, having recently overtaken the US. The increase in female participation has been accompanied by an opposite trend among the male population, which has fallen from % to % over the sample. In other words, the gender  participation gap  between males and females in the UK has fallen by around  percentage points over the past  years, though it remains positive at around  percentage points. The participation of ethnic minorities in the UK labour force has also been on an upward trend since the s, reaching around % in . Labour participation by the white population was, by contrast, on a slightly downward trend prior to the GFC, after which it has flattened off. That leaves participation rates for ethnic minorities today slightly above the levels of the white population. There have been some striking gender-related shifts in the pattern of work. The share of part-time employment among females has been declining, with a corresponding larger share of females working full-time. The opposite is true among males, with the share of men working part-time increasing by  percentage points over the sample. For ethnic minorities, part-time employment has steadily increased, with a pronounced pick up following the crisis. Next, we look at three variables which are often used to capture aspects of  human capital : the highest qualification achieved, the occupation of a person, and the sector in which they are employed. For illustrative purposes, we split the sample into four sub-groups   white men, white women, ethnic minority men, and ethnic minority women   though we also consider more granular sub-sets of these groups. Chart  compares the highest qualification attained among the four sub-samples in  and . The main trend is the same across the board: the share of people with degrees or higher education has almost doubled since . The increases are, however, most pronounced among women and ethnic minorities. For example, ethnic minority females have seen a  percentage point increase between  and . In , around % had a degree or a higher education qualification. Conversely, the shares of people without a qualification have decreased significantly across the four groups, with the trend for UK-born ethnic minority women reducing at a faster pace than for non-UK born ethnic minorities. Both UK-born and non-UK born workers entering the labour force market in the UK are materially more qualified than in the past. Chart  shows the composition of the labour force by occupation across the four sub-groups. Occupational participation differs strikingly by gender, less so by ethnicity. There is a higher share of managers, professional, and associate occupations among men than women. Compared to men, women have a larger representation in administrative, and personal, sales and customer service occupations, while men have a larger representation in skilled trades and process and plant occupations. This holds true across ethnicities. Chart  shows the composition of the UK labour market by sector. The vast majority of men across both ethnic sub-samples work in the  industry  sector (including manufacturing, utilities and mining) and trade and transport sectors. The latter is particularly important for ethnic minority males, where close to % of this sub-group works. On the other hand, the public sector is dominated by females of both ethnicity backgrounds. The share of people working in professional services and finance is similar across the board. Table  shows summary statistics of the distribution of earnings across gender and ethnicity. It shows that white men have the highest mean and median hourly earnings, as well as higher earnings across every percentile of the pay distribution. Males also have higher earnings than females across the pay distribution for both ethnic groups. Ethnic minority females have higher earnings than white females across the distribution. All distributions have a strong positive skew, though white males have the longest upper tail. ###newline###  Charts  plots the distribution of hourly pay in   for males, females and ethnic minorities separately on two dates:  and . It shows that there is a higher peak of low-paid females in  and, to a lesser extent, in . Put differently, more of the distribution of pay among males is skewed towards the upper tail of higher pay rates. Pay distributions between whites and ethnic minorities show fewer differences. Chart  plots the mean hourly pay by decile for different ethnicity and gender groups. In , white males earned more than all other groups, on average, across the entire distribution. The same is broadly true in , except that ethnic minority males now earn more in the top decile. Females continue to earn less than males right across the distribution. The difference between white females and ethnic minority females is relatively small across the distribution. Unconditional gender and ethnicity pay gaps are calculated as the difference between median male (white) gross hourly earnings and median female (non-white) earnings, divided by median male (white) earnings. As with published pay gaps for companies, these measures make no attempt, at this stage, to control for factors driving or explaining these gaps; they are unconditional pay gaps. The unconditional gender pay gap is large over the sample, averaging just over % (Chart ).  This gap has shrunk over the past  years, from around % in the mid-s to around % in . This downward trend is particularly pronounced in the first part of the sample, when the pay gap was falling by, on average, around half a percentage point per year. Since the GFC, however, the gender pay gap has flattened-off and has been essentially unchanged since . At the same time gender pay gaps have been falling, female participation in the workforce has been steadily rising (Chart ).  Increased female participation may have contributed to the shrinking of the gender pay gap during the s and early s, as female representation in certain sectors and occupations expanded. But there is little evidence of these effects over the past decade, during which female participation in the workplace has, if anything, picked up pace but the gender pay gap has been sticky. If we assess by qualification, the largest gender pay gaps are observed for people with GCSE or no qualifications, while the lowest gaps are for workers with a degree or equivalent (Chart ). Generally speaking, the higher the qualifications, the lower the gender pay gap. Location also appears to play an important role. The gender pay gap outside London is consistently higher than in London, across all levels of qualification. The largest gap between London and the rest of the UK is among workers who have no or  other  qualifications. This might be explained by the fact that  other  qualifications includes degrees from outside the UK which may get less recognition. By occupation, consistent with qualifications, the gender pay gap is smaller for professional and administrative occupations than for skilled trades, customer service and plant operatives (Chart ). For almost all occupations, the gender pay gap is higher outside London. In , the gender pay gap outside London remained higher for managers, skilled trades and elementary occupations. For the rest of the occupations, the pay gap in London overtook the respective gap outside London. Broadly speaking, occupations with median hourly pay of more than   (managers, professional, and associate occupations) have lower gender pay gaps than occupations where the median hourly pay is less than  . (sales and customer services, and elementary occupations). Relatedly, there is a clear inverse relationship between the gender pay gap and female-dominated professions. Occupations with a lower share of females tend to be characterised by higher gender pay gaps and vice versa, consistent with increased female representation shrinking gender pay gaps cross-sectionally, if not always over time. Finally, if we look at unconditional gender pay gaps by sector (Chart ), these gaps are broadly-based across sectors. The largest gaps are in the finance sector, both in London and the rest of the UK. These average close to %. This is materially larger than the next-worst sector, ICT, which averages around %. The evolution of the gender pay gap in finance suggests it has fallen only modestly, from over % in the mid-s to around % in . The unconditional ethnicity pay gap exhibits a rather different pattern than the gender pay gap. This gap has also been materially lower, averaging around % over the sample. As the gender gap fell sharply in the decade to , the ethnicity pay gap was broadly stable at around % (yellow dots in Chart ). The ethnicity pay gap then began increasing steadily between  and  (red dots), averaging % over the period. Recently, it has begun to fall (green dots), reaching just under % in . Chart  shows that higher ethnic minority participation in the workplace has only been associated with lower pay gaps very recently. This, and the relatively volatile pattern in the ethnicity pay gap over time, presents something of a puzzle. We might instead expect pay disparities to decline as ethnic minorities become better represented in the labour market through higher participation. Looked at by qualification, white workers earn more than ethnic minorities for most levels of qualifications. The exception are those with  other  or no qualifications living outside London. Perhaps surprisingly given the significant share of ethnic minorities in the workforce, ethnicity pay gaps are larger in London than outside London, for all qualifications (Chart ). These gaps are larger for those with higher levels of qualification, such as a degree. This presents a second puzzle in the unconditional pay gap data. Recent data do not change this picture. In the latest calendar year (), ethnicity pay gaps are positive across all qualifications, averaging %. They remain larger in London than elsewhere, with the highest ethnicity pay gaps in degree and A-level qualification categories. Unconditional ethnicity pay gaps are still consistently smaller than unconditional gender pay gaps. Ethnicity pay gaps differ significantly by occupation and sector. They are largest in managerial, professional and skilled occupations and lowest, or even negative, in elementary, personal service and sales and customer occupations (Chart ). This is the mirror-image of gender, where pay gaps were largest among the lowest-paid occupations. By sector, pay gaps are largest in the professional and finance sectors (Chart ). In other words, ethnicity pay gaps are largest among the highest-paid. If we look at ethnic minority workers at a more granular level, some interesting cohort effects emerge. There is a very wide dispersion of pay among different ethnic minority cohorts, with some having negative and others positive pay gaps compared with their white counterparts (Chart ). Median hourly pay is highest for those of Chinese ethnicity, at just over  , or around % higher than for whites. There are also negative pay gaps, though smaller ones, for workers from a mixed/multiple ethnic and Indian background. At the other end of the spectrum, there are significantly positive pay gaps for other ethnic minority cohorts, including black and Afro-Caribbean workers. The largest pay gaps are for workers from a Pakistani and Bangladeshi background, which average % and %, respectively (Chart ). These large pay gap differences between different ethnic minority cohorts beg the question of whether it is useful to think about a single  ethnicity pay gap . Whether an ethnic minority individual is born in the UK or not also plays an important role in their pay. Chart  shows that ethnic minorities born in the UK (apart from those from Bangladeshi and Pakistani backgrounds) earn more than UK-born white people. Educational attainment is part of the explanation here. Although ethnic minorities born in the UK are a small part of our sample (%), they are almost twice as likely to have a degree relative to white UK-born workers (% versus %). In stark contrast, most ethnic minorities born outside the UK earn considerably less than white people born outside the UK. This in part reflects compositional effects, as a higher proportion of non-UK born ethnic minorities have no qualifications compared to their white counterparts. On average, ethnic minority women earn more than white women, whereas ethnic minority men earn less than white men (Chart ). This is also true in the latest data. Unconditionally, there is a clear and well-defined pay gap for females, a clear and well-defined pay gap for ethnicity but, somewhat surprisingly, no clear, well-defined pay gap for ethnic minority females. This is a third puzzle in the unconditional pay data. ###newline###  In this section, we explore the factors contributing to gender and ethnicity pay gaps. Accounting for individual and job characteristics helps us to estimate conditional gender and ethnicity pay gaps. Can pay gaps be explained by characteristics of the individuals (such as their level of education or location) or the jobs they are doing (such as the sector or occupation)? How much of the pay gap remains  unexplained  once these characteristics are accounted for? As well as providing a greater understanding of the drivers of pay gaps, this approach helps resolve some of the puzzles otherwise apparent in the unconditional pay gap data. The ability to  explain  pay gaps in terms of worker or job characteristics does not necessarily imply these pay gaps are justified or are not therefore a policy problem. For example, if the education system is working inequitably across gender or race, in a way that causes pay gaps to emerge, this would be a clear market failure that would justify policy intervention. In other cases the choice of an occupation or sector may be a personal decision, reflecting lifestyle and values, and less obviously a market failure or policy concern. The decompositions we carry out aim to identify the role of individual and environmental factors. One way of doing so is by using the so-called Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition. This decomposes the gap between the wages of two groups into two parts. The first captures the share of the gap explained by the different compositional characteristics of the two groups. The second captures the sensitivity of pay to those characteristics, something which is not typically observable. Suppose y is our variable of interest, in this case wages. We have two groups, say male and female. We assume y is explained by a vector of determinants, x, according to the following model: where the vectors of the   parameters include intercepts. To keep things simple, assume there is a single factor   education   and that males benefit more, wage-wise, than females from a given level of education. In other words, at each educational level (x), the level of wages (y) are higher for males than females. Assume, again for simplicity, that males also have higher levels of educational attainment than females. This means that, for compositional reasons, we would also expect males to earn more than females. where x        and x        are vectors of explanatory variables evaluated at their means for males and females, respectively. The Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition allows us to split up the overall gap into the part that is attributable to (i) differences in x's (the so-called  accounted for  component capturing compositional differences) and (ii) differences in the  's (the  unaccounted for  component reflecting the greater impact of a given factor on males versus females). In other words, the wage gap between the two groups can be expressed as: In this way, we can split the gender pay gap into a part that can be accounted for by females having different characteristics (x's) than males, and a part resulting from females being treated differentially to males given those characteristics ( 's). This expression can be further rewritten as (), which compares the regressions coefficients to their hypothetical value in a world of no labour market discrimination. We use an extensive list of factors or characteristics, x, to help explain pay gaps. Some of these relate to the characteristics of the individual worker   for example, their number of years in employment, their tenure in post, where they live, their age and their educational qualifications. Other factors relate to the nature of the job itself   whether it is full or part-time, the occupation, sector and job-type. Both factors, individual and job-specific, are likely to be important in explaining pay. Chart  shows the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition of the gender pay gap over the sample, when the average gender pay gap in the UK was close to %. From the decomposition, around half of that gap can be accounted for by compositional effects, arising from the different characteristics of either the worker or the job they are carrying out. That leaves around  percentage points of the pay gap unaccounted for by these factors. In other words, around half of the gender pay gap is difficult to justify on fundamental grounds, consistent at least with some significant degree of gender pay  bias . Of those factors explaining the gender pay gap, the most important relate to the characteristics of the job rather than the individual. Occupation, sector, and the full/part-time nature of work are the most important factors accounting for the gender pay gap. It is difficult to know how much these reflect personal choice (workers  preference for a certain sector or way of working) rather than legacy environmental factors (such as the preponderance of males in certain professions or sectors). Looked at over time, the halving of the gender pay gap since the mid-s has been driven roughly equally by accounted and unaccounted for components (Chart ). The main factor causing the shrinkage in the explained component is qualifications. While at the start of the sample the qualification component was adding to the gender pay gap, by the end it was dragging. This reflects the significant increase in relative educational attainment by females over the period. The unexplained   or  gender pay bias    component has shrunk somewhat, though remains significant at just under % at the end of the period. Looked at regionally, although the unconditional gender pay gap is relatively stable over the sample in London, once we allow for compositional effects the picture is more promising. The unexplained ( pay bias ) component of pay has fallen over time in London, reaching .% by the end of the sample. Outside London, the gender pay gap has also been on a downward trend, driven by both explained and unexplained factors. Next we implement the same methodology for the ethnicity pay gaps. Chart  shows the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition of the ethnicity pay gap over the full sample. The conditional ethnicity pay gap averages a relatively modest % over the sample, smaller than for gender. This is no longer the case once we account for compositional effects. These point to higher, rather than lower pay, for ethnic minorities. Specifically, ethnic minority workers tend to be employed in regions where wages are higher (% of ethnic minorities work in London) and tend to have higher qualifications than their white counterparts. Once these compositional effects are accounted for, the unexplained ( pay bias ) ethnicity pay gap is as large as for females. It averages just under  percentage points over the sample. This demonstrates one of the perils of interpreting raw, unconditional, pay gap data too literally. Replicating this analysis for people born in the UK reduces by half the size of the pay bias. Conversely, for people born outside the UK from ethnic minority backgrounds we estimate a significantly larger pay bias, at around  percentage points. Looking over time (Chart ), the unconditional ethnicity pay gap was broadly stable from the mid-s until , since when it has declined. That decline can to a large extent be explained by the rise in the relative educational performance of ethnic minorities which, by the end of the sample, is subtracting  percentage points from the pay gap. By contrast, the unexplained ethnicity pay gap has been largely unchanged over the sample. Not only is the unexplained ( pay bias ) part of the ethnicity pay gap as large as for gender; it appears also to have been more persistent and has shown fewer signs of falling over time. The ethnicity pay gap problem in the UK is every bit as acute as the gender pay gap problem, contrary to the message from the raw pay gap data. The decomposition also helps explain the otherwise puzzling finding of a larger ethnicity pay gap in London than elsewhere in the UK. That larger gap appears largely to reflect compositional effects. Once these are accounted for, the unexplained ethnicity pay gap in London, at  percentage points, is similar to the sample average, at just under  percentage points, and is about as persistent. An alternative, and more flexible, way of exploring the determinants of pay gaps is by using regression techniques. In our baseline regressions, we use the approach of Goldin () to estimate gender and ethnicity pay gaps. Given the rich set of controls in our dataset, this offers robust estimates of conditional gender and ethnicity pay gaps. It also provides useful insights into the factors, individual and job-specific, most important for driving headline pay gaps. We regress the natural log of average gross hourly pay on a binary female coefficient and a set of controls, wider than the ones used in Goldin (). The set of controls comprises both individual and job-specific characteristics. It includes: age, female-age group interactions, usual hours worked, public or private sector, full time or part time, contract type, whether born in the UK, has a child under , female and child under  interaction, occupation, female and occupation interaction, educational qualifications, tenure, region of home and sector (Annex Table A). Once we take account of these factors, Table  suggests that there was, on average, a conditional gender pay gap of just under -% between  and . This gender pay gap is highly statistically significant. To understand how it has changed over time, we split the sample into five periods (-, -, -, -, -) and re-estimate (). As Chart  shows, the gender pay gap has fallen over time, though it remains around -% and is statistically significant by the end. ###newline###  We can replicate this regression for ethnicity with the same set of controls, except that the occupation, age groups, and children under  variables now interact with the ethnic minority variable.  if person does not belong to white ethnic group  if person belongs to white ethnic group With this specification, the conditional gap for ethnic minorities averages around -% and is again significant at the % level. Looked at over time, Chart  shows that this gap was quite volatile in the early part of the sample, although the coefficients are also insignificant for this period. Since , the ethnicity pay gap has remained in double digits for most of the period and has been statistically significant. The raw, unconditional pay data suggests that wage patterns may vary significantly across different ethnic minority groups, with some pay gaps negative and others positive. To see whether these effects hold true having accounted for compositional effects, we can run () with separate binary variables for each ethnicity group i relative to a white control group, namely: mixed/multiple ethnic groups, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese, other Asian background, Black/African/Caribbean/Black British and  Other .  if person does belongs to ethnic group i  if person belongs to white ethnic group From Table , the mixed ethnic group does not have a statistically significant pay gap. All other ethnic groups do have a significant and negative pay gap, varying from -% and -% for Indians and Chinese through to -% and -%, respectively, for workers from a Bangladeshi and Pakistani ethnic background. In other words, once we account for compositional effects, a more consistent pattern of negative ethnicity pay gaps emerges, although the size of the gap varies significantly across different ethnic minority groups. ###newline###  We can extend these specifications by considering interaction effects between gender and ethnicity. This is achieved by adding two dummy variables to the original specification (): ln  pa    =           Female    p   Ethnic minorit    a    Female    Ethnic minorit         Controls       if person does not belong to white ethnic group  if person belongs to white ethnic group As shown in Table , we find that the conditional gender wage gap (for white women) remains around -%. For female ethnic minorities this becomes larger at around -%, suggesting an additional  pay bias . This resolves another puzzle in the unconditional pay data. By contrast, ethnic minority men suffer no such additional bias. Indeed, at around - percentage points, their pay gap is smaller than for white women. ###newline###  If we run these regressions over time, the same broad pattern emerges. White men earn more than any of the other three categories (ethnic minority males and females and white females), although all of these pay gaps have shrunk somewhat over the past  years (Chart ). Pay gaps for ethnic minority males have tended to be a little smaller, but have also fallen less rapidly. Pay gaps for ethnic minority women, while halving over the period, remain strikingly high. Just because a pay gap can be explained by a set of individual and work-specific characteristics does not mean it is necessarily either reasonable or justifiable. Differences in these characteristics may themselves suggest inequalities or biases that need rectifying. It is interesting to examine what our regression results tell us about the relative importance of various factors in determining pay gaps. To assess this, we run separate regressions for white men, white women, ethnic minority men and ethnic minority women as the effect of various factors on pay is not homogenous for these groups. Some key findings include: Education. The  penalty  for having no qualification, compared to having a degree, is on average %. That penalty exists irrespective of gender or ethnicity.  The penalty is not equal across these groupings, however. This penalty is highest for white women, at %, and lowest for ethnic minorities at %. The story is slightly different when we compare degrees with  other  qualifications. For ethnic minorities, where university degrees from abroad often end up in this category, the penalty is a lot smaller, at around %, compared with non-ethnic minorities. Age. Compared to the earnings of the - age group, each subsequent age group earns more up to around the mid-s, where the earnings  premium  flattens out a bit. For example, those aged - earn a pay premium, on average, of around % compared with those aged -. This pay premium is notably larger for white men than women or ethnic minorities. Men aged - earn an  extra  wage premium of around % compared with the other sub-groups. Part-time and non-permanent work. Part-time work, compared with full-time employment, reduces earnings across all four sub-groups, on average by %. This discount is larger for white men (%) than for ethnic minorities and white women (%). If employment is not permanent, this also reduces earnings across the sub-groups, with white men again being affected the most (% reduction in pay). Children under . Viewed on its own, having a child under  appears to have a positive effect on the earnings of both white men and women, of % and % respectively. For ethnic minority men, the effect is not statistically significant while for ethnic minority women earnings are reduced by %. The results are more interesting if we interact having a child under  with a variable capturing full or part-time employment. While for white men, the effect on earnings is still positive, for women the effect of having a child under  is only positive for women working part-time. For women working full-time, having a child under the  reduces earnings by around %. This suggests women in full-time jobs experience a  maternity penalty , whereas men and women in part-time employment do not. Financial sector. Compared to earnings in the benchmark sector (agriculture), most sectors have higher pay. The sector with the highest relative pay is finance, with a % premium relative to the benchmark. This premium is notably higher for men than women (% versus %), although it is highest for ethnic minority men (%). These are large pay gaps, bearing in mind these estimates take account of differences in the individual characteristics of the workers, such as age and educational achievement. Born in the UK. Being born in the UK, on average, leads to slightly lower earnings than not. However, this average masks sharply opposing trends among whites and ethnic minorities. Being born in the UK and white reduces earnings by around % compared with whites born outside the UK. This largely reflects the effects of those with  other qualifications , and the fact that white people born outside the UK tend to be more educated. By contrast, ethnic minorities born in the UK boosts earnings by around % relative to non-UK born ethnic minorities. UK-born ethnic minorities tend to be more educated and earn more across all the types of qualifications, compared with non-UK born ethnic minorities. London. Compared to the benchmark (the North), the region in which people live and work plays a relatively very small role in determining their pay, with one exception   London and the South East. A job there boosts earnings, relative to the North, by % and % respectively. This effect is present across all four sub-groups. The  London effect  is if anything more pronounced among white women, who earn % more. ###newline###  Let us conclude by summarising some of our main findings and then setting out some of the potential next steps, policy-wise, that flow from this analysis. First, the good news is that, once we control for various job and individual-specific factors, there is clear evidence of progress having been made in shrinking gender and ethnicity pay gaps in the UK over the past quarter-century or so. Based on the results from the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, these gaps have shrunk by around half for females, and by a little less than that for ethnic minorities. Second, the less good news is that these gender and ethnicity pay gaps remain large even once various compositional effects are taken into account, at around  percentage points. Pay gaps have not only been large but persistent, strikingly so among ethnic minorities, even once we make allowance for differences in skill and job attributes. This suggests, despite progress, much remains to be done. Third, even where we can  explain  pay gaps using various fundamental factors, this should not be taken to imply these gaps are necessarily justifiable. For example, consistent and large education and skills differences between cohorts could themselves be taken as evidence of a policy failure. So too might a preponderance of certain types in certain sectors or occupations. Fourth, consistent with that, our results suggest that existing pay biases can be amplified and exaggerated by the effects of age, the nature of the employment contract, educational qualifications and having children under the age of . On average, these too tend to further the pay disadvantage for women and ethnic minorities. In terms of policy implications, a number of important government initiatives are already underway, among central banks and more widely. The Bank of England began publishing its gender pay gaps in  and has chosen voluntarily to publish its ethnicity pay gap too since . In , the median gender pay gap was % and the median ethnicity pay gap was just under %, reflecting lower representation of both groups at senior levels. Published pay gaps were a further useful prompt for action by the Bank. The Bank is committed to closing these pay gaps, including by setting stretching targets for representation, in general and at senior levels. Good progress is being made. The share of BAME and female staff below senior management in the Bank currently stands at % and %, respectively, compared to targets of % and %. At senior management, BAME and female representation is % and %, compared to targets of % and %. A wide array of initiatives are underway to ensure the Bank meets these targets. Other central banks have also made a further push towards improving their staff diversity, although few publish pay gaps. The ECB s Executive Board introduced gender targets in  in order to double the share of women in management by . As of the end of , % of management positions were held by women compared with a target of % for the end of . For the most senior management roles the share was % against a target of % for the end of . The ECB announced additional measures last year. The Fed announced a Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan for -, aimed at fostering diversity in the organisation. In order to foster transparency and accountability, they report the composition of their employees by diversity statistics annually. Looking beyond central banks, the analysis presented here suggests some clear directions of travel. First, at present gender pay gap reporting in the UK only covers companies with more than  employees. In practice, this means it covers only around % of the UK working population in the private sector.   To tackle the pay gap comprehensively, this suggests there is a strong case for extending the pay reporting regime to smaller companies   say, those with  or more staff. Second, there is currently no compulsory system of company reporting on the ethnicity pay gap in the UK, though the government has consulted on doing so. The ethnicity pay gap is at least as large as for females, and if anything has been more persistent, as shown by the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition results. In my opinion, there are therefore strong grounds for extending compulsory reporting to ethnicity as well as gender. This analysis also emphasises the importance of looking at labour market outcomes for different ethnic minority groups, rather than necessarily treating ethnic minorities as a single group. Third, at present only a handful of countries internationally require companies to publish gender and ethnicity pay gaps. There is a strong case for reporting diversity pay gaps, on an internationally-harmonised basis, to allow cross-country as well as cross-company comparison. Given their expertise on labour market issues, this might be something on which the OECD could lead. The international central banking community could also help lead by example. The benefits of internationally-harmonised disclosures, as an incentive device for action, have recently been demonstrated in the case of climate change disclosures.  Today, financial firms with around $ trillion assets under management have committed to harmonised reporting using the Task-Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) template. This has encouraged wider scrutiny of, and actions to mitigate, the risks to companies  profits and balance sheets posed by climate change. Pay gap disclosure could have a similarly profound behavioural effect on companies. Fourth, there is also a strong case for improving the sets of data available publicly to monitor progress towards equality of pay and opportunity in the workplace. One example of useful additional data would be longitudinal data tracking individuals from school into employment, perhaps using administrative data or new surveys. This would help to understand the key determinants, and obstacles, to career and pay progression. Fifth and finally, published pay gap data are imperfect and can sometimes give a misleading impression of diversity patterns. We have demonstrated how raw pay gap data can sometimes give rise to puzzles. We have also demonstrated, however, that a careful consideration of various compositional factors can resolve these puzzles and provide a clearer picture of underlying patterns. There is no reason why companies could not use these techniques when interpreting their own results. Others have argued that publishing pay gap data may discourage companies from investing in a pipeline of diverse talent for the future, as hiring younger and lower-paid workers could actually show up as a worsening pay gap in the near-term, even if it bears fruit longer-term. These are legitimate concerns. But they are far from being knock-down arguments when it comes to publishing pay gap data. Published pay gaps are a starting point for corporate and national accountability and explanation, not an end-point. No single metric can perfectly summarise all dimensions of diversity. But publication of a single metric can, and has, served as the catalyst for an explanation and action, at the company and national levels. For example, it prompts companies to justify their misses and to explain how and over what horizon they expect their pay gap and diversity targets to be hit. There is an analogy here with my day job   inflation-targeting using monetary policy. The single target does not wholly or perfectly summarise all dimensions of the economy. But having the target serves as a catalyst for explanation and action   an explanation for misses and an action plan for returning inflation to target. That improves policy accountability and societal outcomes. The same could be true of companies when it comes to diversity policies and outcomes.
