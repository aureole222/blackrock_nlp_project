The world economic outlook##NewPara##The most significant news concerned the US, where recent output growth had again been surprisingly strong: .% in  Q after .% in  Q. Final domestic demand growth had risen to .%, with negative contributions to GDP from net trade and stockbuilding. There had also been more marked signs that the strength of demand was feeding through to prices and costs. Quarterly growth in employment costs had been .% in Q, up from .% in  Q; the month- on-month rate of increase in the CPI had risen from .% in January to .% in February and to .% in March; core CPI inflation had risen too, above expectations. The market was firmly expecting the FOMC to raise interest rates at its  May meeting, with some looking for an increase of  basis points.##NewPara##Equity markets in the US, and perhaps in consequence elsewhere, had been highly volatile over the month. The NASDAQ was now substantially off the levels reached early in the year. Whereas the possibility of a large and disorderly equity price fall remained one of the key risks to the world economy, the equity market had risen so far over the past few years that an orderly correction need not give rise to concerns about the macroeconomic outlook; some correction was welcome, and indeed could usefully contribute to restraining US domestic demand growth.##NewPara##If a further correction were to occur, which was far from certain, the implications for output and inflation would depend on the nature of the underlying shock. There would be an important difference between, on the one hand, a greater-than-expected tightening of US monetary policy in response to excess demand but with the story of significantly improved supply-side performance basically intact; and, on the other hand, news that the economy s prospective supply capacity had##NewPara##not improved by as much as seemed to be built into current equity valuations and borrowing decisions. In the latter case, output growth could potentially fall back as prices accelerated. It was not possible to be confident about which, if either, of an aggregate demand or an aggregate supply shock was the more likely.##NewPara##Against this background, the Committee incorporated in its central projections an assumption that the outlook for world economic growth had again strengthened, but with the balance of risks on the downside.##NewTopic##Exchange rates##NewPara##The euro had fallen by around % on its effective exchange rate index over the month; and by % against sterling, including % in the days immediately before the Committee s meeting. Given the significance of sterling s further appreciation for the UK economic outlook, the Committee debated a series of possible reasons for euro weakness that were being canvassed in the markets.##NewPara##One possible explanation was the gap between US and euro-area supply-side performance. If US trend productivity growth had risen relative to that of the euro area, it was to be expected that investment capital would flow to the US, accompanied by an adjustment in the real exchange rate. There was some support for that view in capital account data for the past few years. However, it was difficult to see how relative supply-side performance could explain the euro s sharp depreciation over recent months, particularly as there had been some positive news about structural reform in euro-area economies. Moreover, this story was not easily reconciled with the strength of euro-area equity markets.##NewPara##A second possible explanation was the suggestion that some market participants felt that the ECB was  behind the curve . But looking at, for example, unemployment levels in the euro area as a whole, it was also possible to argue that policy was  ahead of the curve . Overall, given the news about the outlook and the ECB s objectives, policy seemed to be within the range which would generally be expected. Consistent with that, bond yields had not risen in a way that suggested that medium-to-long run inflation expectations were out of line with the ECB s goals, and so did not suggest that ECB policy lacked credibility. There had, though, been some market comment about##NewPara##the recent pace of money (and credit) growth, which was now well above the ECB s quantitative reference value. It was conceivable that the market was uncertain about the relative importance of this factor in the ECB s broader strategy of medium-term price stability. But it was not easy to see how this could explain such a large and persistent fall in the external value of the euro.##NewPara##A third possible explanation was that some market participants were concerned about the diverse range of official commentary on euro-area monetary policy, from finance ministries, national central banks and the ECB. Related to that, it was conceivable that there were concerns that communication##NewPara##  and perhaps even the formulation   of ECB policy would become still more complicated as membership of the euro area expanded. More broadly, the market had apparently been concerned about recent political developments in some euro-area countries.##NewPara##The Committee could not identify a compelling economic explanation for the recent euro weakness. Some members were inclined to believe that the recent falls had reflected momentum, or what might be called  psychological factors . There was anecdote suggesting that some large trades had had a more persistent impact than usual.##NewPara##The Committee concluded that the current levels of the euro-dollar and euro-sterling exchange rates were unlikely to be sustained. But while sterling was expected to fall at some point against the euro, it was impossible to predict the timing or size of any such adjustment. A likely trigger could be a large fall in global equity markets, led by the US; that could prompt a fall in the dollar against the euro, and possibly therefore in the sterling-euro rate.  Alternatively, it was possible that sterling might decouple from the dollar in the event of greater market awareness of differences in the##NewPara##relative cyclical positions and in supply-side prospects for the US and the UK.##NewPara##The Committee decided to assume in the central projection that sterling s path over the next two years would lie halfway between a constant nominal rate and a depreciation in line with interest rate differentials. Although some members preferred the former and some the latter, a majority preferred an average between the two.##NewPara##The Committee s projections used as the starting point a  working-day average of sterling s exchange rate index, which was ., around  % higher than on the path assumed in the February##NewPara##Inflation Report. By the time of the Committee s meeting, sterling had risen further, to around   and so was materially above the starting point assumed in the Report projections.##NewTopic##Money and asset prices##NewPara##Household and corporate sector borrowing##NewPara##M had grown by .% in the year to April and, adjusting for millennium-related effects, had now been in a %-% range for the past six months or so. Household credit growth had again been strong, at .% in March   the fastest rate since . Net secured lending had risen quite sharply, following an earlier pick up in mortgage loan approvals. The approvals data had also risen in the latest month. The household money and credit data therefore presented a contrasting picture to the recent survey evidence of a fall in consumer confidence.##NewPara##Private non-financial corporate sector (PNFC)  borrowing   from banks and from capital markets   had also been robust. In  Q PNFC total external finance had been stronger than at any time since  Q (adjusting for the boost to borrowing in  Q caused by changes to Advance Corporation Tax). There was little evidence of distress borrowing. Sectoral data showed that the manufacturing sector had been repaying bank borrowing in Q. The Bank s regional Agents had earlier suggested that recent borrowing was largely for investment; over a slightly longer period, it had also financed merger and acquisition activity.##NewPara##Overall, the money and credit data presented a different picture from the weaker-than-expected outturn for GDP growth in Q. Taking the monetary data at face value might suggest that either output would pick up again or that the Q figure could be revised up.##NewPara##Recent data on the housing market were somewhat mixed. The Nationwide price index had risen by .% in April, compared with .% in March, and the twelve-month rate had risen from .% to .%. The Halifax index had risen by .% in April, having fallen by .% and .% in March and February respectively. The twelve month rate was .% in April. A quite different##NewPara##picture was presented, though, by a preview of the April Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors  measure of house price pressure. The number of particulars delivered had fallen slightly in March, but were still well up on a year ago. The House Builders  Federation site visits balance had fallen slightly over the month, but the net reservation balance had risen slightly.##NewPara##Put together with the lending data and with anecdote of financing terms being eased over recent months in the face of intense competitive conditions, the overall evidence of the housing market having peaked was perhaps slightly weaker than in the previous month. It was possible, however, that the regional pattern was changing, with slightly slower growth in London and the South East than a few months ago. Looking further ahead, the Committee judged that house prices rises would moderate, but by slightly less than assumed in its February central projection.##NewTopic##Demand and output##NewPara##The Q GDP data presented an important puzzle. Growth was recorded at .%, which was below the Committee s February central assumption. Official data suggested that output growth might have been accounted for entirely by net trade, which had apparently bounced back: in particular, exports to non-EU countries had grown by .% over the quarter. If so, domestic demand growth had been zero. But growth in retail sales had clearly been positive, and other indicators also pointed to continued consumption growth. If so, other components of domestic demand must have fallen quite sharply.##NewPara##While business investment intentions had recently weakened, this survey evidence was about periods beyond Q. Earlier surveys, which were more relevant to Q, had suggested positive business investment growth. Recent survey evidence might be consistent with a fall in stockbuilding in Q, perhaps reflecting an unwind of a millennium-related build up, but this did not sit comfortably with the robust corporate sector borrowing data. There was clearer evidence that government consumption had been weak in Q. Another possible factor was that energy production had been weak during the quarter. Bank staff estimates suggested that, excluding energy, GDP growth had been somewhat stronger than .%. If so, it was possible on the expenditure side that the energy- related component of consumption had been weak.##NewPara##Overall it would probably be some time before the picture was clearer. The Committee thought that the Q GDP data contained limited information about the future path of output, but agreed that it would be a mistake to give them no weight in the immediate policy decision. Looking back over a longer period, it did now seem that output growth had peaked in  Q.##NewPara##Recent forward-looking survey data contained mixed signals. Survey evidence did not seem to point to a fall in manufacturing output, although the outlook had clearly weakened given sterling s strength; and indicators of service sector and construction activity, while slightly weaker, were still clearly pointing to growth. Other surveys implied that export orders had fallen, as had business optimism and, in particular, consumer confidence.##NewPara##There seemed to be somewhat clearer news on the fiscal position. The / surplus had been even larger than the Government had forecast at the time of its March Budget, with both weaker- than-expected departmental spending and higher-than-expected revenues. On spending, it seemed that departments were making greater-than-anticipated use of their ability to roll over unspent amounts into the next fiscal year. It was therefore an important question whether that would##NewPara##continue in future years or whether, as the Committee assumed, annual nominal spending would rise to the budgeted amount in the current year. On the revenue side, the question was whether output had been stronger than measured or whether the effective tax yield had risen, so that there had in effect been a further unanticipated tightening of fiscal policy.##NewTopic##Labour market conditions##NewPara##The wedge between the earnings and settlement data remained. The increase in the headline Average Earnings Index had risen to .% in the three months to February, the fastest since July . This figure was affected by millennium-related payments, and so was judged to overstate underlying earnings growth. The twelve month rate of earnings growth in February was .%. There was a major difference between earnings growth and settlements: settlements over the same period had been .%. Members differed in their interpretation of these data. Some, noting that on any reasonable assumptions earnings growth in the UK was well above the rate of productivity growth, were concerned about consequent upward pressures on prices. The recent very strong earnings increases would most likely have some impact on prices, including via the effect on demand of##NewPara##higher incomes: that was assumed in the central projection. Others believed that settlements had a bigger impact than earnings growth on prices, and that unmeasured productivity improvements would help to offset rapid earnings growth. They preferred an assumption that the recent spike up in earnings growth would have a smaller effect on prices than had been assumed in the central projection.##NewPara##The Labour Force Survey measure of employment had increased by , (.%) in the three months to February, in line with recent quarters. The number of people unemployed had fallen slightly. Evidence from surveys and the Bank s regional Agents suggested that skill shortages remained a concern, but had perhaps stabilised.##NewPara##Overall the labour market remained tight. While it was not obviously tightening further, there was not much evidence of conditions easing.##NewTopic##Prices and costs##NewPara##RPIX inflation was .% in March, with the fall of . percentage points on the month being slightly larger than expected. There continued to be a large divergence between goods price inflation, which at -.% was the lowest on record; and services inflation, which had remained at .%.##NewPara##Some members did not think that the size of the sectoral divergence was significant for the overall inflation outlook, although it was an unwelcome sign of imbalances in the economy. Overall, the Committee agreed that there was little if any news in the latest data relevant to the outlook.##NewPara##In terms of the outlook for prices, an important consideration was the impact of any supply side changes in the economy. The Committee decided to retain in its central projection February s assumptions about structural pressures on domestic margins (and the latest projections had also incorporated a downward adjustment to margins on imports). Also as in February, some members preferred to assume a smaller effect, and some preferred a larger effect. In addition, some members preferred to assume that trend productivity in the UK would rise towards the levels achieved in the US, which would reduce the rate of increase in prices for any given rate of earnings growth.##NewTopic##The May output growth and inflation projections##NewPara##The Committee agreed the projections to be published in the Inflation Report on Wednesday  May.##NewPara##On the assumption of an official repo rate of .% over the next two years, the central projection was for output growth to slow slightly from % to a rate at or a little above trend. The profile was slightly stronger than in the February Report. The balance of risks was on the downside, principally on account of the possibility of a setback to world economic growth.##NewPara##On the central projection, RPIX inflation rose to around the  % target over the coming year or so and then stabilised at around that level. The profile was much the same as in the February Report, with the effects of sterling s appreciation broadly offsetting those of slightly stronger world and domestic demand and a higher profile for earnings growth. The balance of risks was slightly on the upside in the first year and on the downside in the second year.##NewPara##The fan chart projections did not incorporate a risk of a sharp fall in sterling s exchange rate against the euro, since the timing and size of any such correction were both extremely uncertain. Nor did the projections reflect a risk, seen by some members, of earnings growth being higher than assumed.##NewPara##As described above, there was a range of preferred assumptions for the path of the nominal exchange rate, price-cost margins, trend productivity, and the impact on prices of the unwinding of the recent rise in earnings growth; these were presented in Table .B on page  of the May Inflation Report. Different members preferred different combinations of these assumptions, with the effect of either reducing or raising the inflation projection at the two-year horizon by up to half a percentage point.##NewTopic##The implications for policy of strong domestic inflationary pressures versus the disinflationary effects of sterling’s further appreciation##NewPara##The Committee discussed the challenges which monetary policy faced on account of, on the one hand, the domestic inflationary pressures generated by strong final domestic demand growth and a tight labour market; and, on the other hand, the downward pressures on inflation from the prospective effects on net trade and import prices of sterling's further appreciation against the euro. There seemed to be material risks to the outlook whatever the Committee s immediate policy decision.##NewPara##A risk if interest rates were raised was that inflation could fall further below target if, for example, the Q GDP estimate turned out to be an accurate guide to underlying developments and output growth continued to slow. Moreover, in the view of some members, a policy tightening could put further upwards pressure on sterling, which could aggravate the downward pressures on inflation and output. As well as materially undershooting the inflation target for a while, some viable businesses might be unnecessarily damaged. In addition, a further rise in sterling could increase the risk of sterling falling sharply later. Hence, tightening now could increase the deviation of inflation from target, both in the short run and further out.##NewPara##If, however, interest rates were maintained at %, there was a risk that policy might prove to be too easy if, for example, tight labour market conditions were to lead to persistently high earnings growth. That could end up being a classic case of acting too late to head off accumulating inflationary pressures, and that too could damage the real economy. In addition, it was likely that sterling would fall back at some point, given that its rate against the euro in particular seemed unsustainable. If domestically-generated inflation had not been checked by then, policy might need to be tightened quite sharply in order to bring about a material slowdown in output growth. This was not certain, however. For example, if a fall in sterling were prompted by a global equity market correction, which on one view was the most likely trigger, there might be partly offsetting influences on the inflation outlook, although the inflationary effects of a depreciation would tend to come through rather more quickly than the disinflationary effects of a fall in wealth.##NewPara##Views differed on the relative risks depending on assessments of the current conjuncture and individual members  preferred central projection assumptions. There was, however, agreement that it was relevant that inflation was currently below the inflation target, and that sterling was materially higher at the time of the meeting than the  working day average used as the assumed starting point in the Inflation Report projections.  The actual exchange rate at the time of the meeting was judged to be more relevant to the immediate policy decision.##NewTopic##Tactical issues##NewPara##The Committee discussed two tactical issues.##NewPara##First, the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) was expected by the market to increase the Fed funds target by at least  basis points, perhaps by  basis points, on  May. Assuming that the FOMC did tighten, it was conceivable that sterling might decouple somewhat from the dollar, and so perhaps fall slightly against the euro, if UK rates had not been raised again this month, since that might help to signal that the US and UK did not face the same conjunctural issues.##NewPara##Second, the Committee discussed a suggestion that, if the repo rate were maintained at %, the Bank should intervene in the foreign exchange markets, ideally as part of concerted intervention to strengthen the euro. A majority of members did not want to contemplate intervention in the current circumstances.##NewTopic##The immediate policy decision##NewPara##A variety of arguments were identified for maintaining interest rates at %. The central projection for inflation was broadly in line with the target in the second year of the forecast period, with the level of output around most estimates of trend. While some members had preferred assumptions producing a somewhat higher inflation projection, this was offset by the fact that sterling was, at the time of the meeting, nearly % above the starting point assumed in the May projections. For those members who had favoured a tightening of policy in the previous month, the balance of argument had shifted to leaving rates unchanged this month. This was partly because of the Q GDP figure, but it was also on account of sterling s sharp appreciation since then and the##NewPara##implications which these developments, if they persisted, would have for the inflation outlook. On the economic analysis there was no need to change rates this month, and as a matter of tactics doing so might compound the problem of sterling s appreciation.##NewPara##There was, however, a wider range of views on the underlying picture.  Some members remained very concerned about the strength of domestically-generated inflationary pressures, reflecting the tight labour market and still-buoyant final domestic demand growth.  There were upside risks to inflation from earnings and the possibility of a decline in sterling s exchange rate. Sterling s level against the euro was unlikely to be sustainable; the most likely resolution of this was a rise in the euro s nominal exchange rate against sterling, but the timing was extremely uncertain. Taking these things together, there was a general need to restrain domestic demand growth. This would also guard against having to tighten policy more aggressively later if, for example, sterling fell sharply. While it was therefore more likely than not that policy would need to be tightened again in  due course, a tightening was not needed this month; the immediate outlook provided time to see more evidence on output and expenditure and on exchange market developments. Some members taking this view were concerned that economic agents and commentators may have concluded from the recent macroeconomic performance that the Committee could, as a general matter, achieve the inflation target and stabilise the path of output with a series of fairly small changes in interest rates. That was by no means assured. The uncomfortable current combination of internal and external conditions suggested that the operation of policy in the period ahead might easily be considerably more difficult than over the past three years.##NewPara##While agreeing that the conjuncture was particularly challenging, other members did not agree that, other things being equal, policy was more likely than not to be tightened further. First, taken at face value the Q GDP numbers and the fall in several survey indicators might suggest that the earlier interest rate increases had had a faster and larger effect than expected. Second, to tighten policy would tend to put further upwards pressure on sterling, compounding the problem of economic imbalances. Attempting to slow domestic demand growth below trend by tightening now in anticipation of a fall in sterling would run the risk both of increasing the degree of undershoot of inflation relative to the target in the short run, and of increasing the size of any inflation overshoot later, by exacerbating the size of sterling s overvaluation now. Third, sterling was most likely to fall in response to a global equity market correction, which would tend to reduce domestic demand and##NewPara##so help to offset upward pressures on inflation from depreciation. In such circumstances, policy might not need to be tightened aggressively. Fourth, inflation was still materially below target, and was set to remain so for a while, which provided a cushion against a short-term inflationary shock from a fall in sterling. Fifth, to the extent that movements in sterling proved to be erratic, they had no necessary implications for policy. Sixth, some members placed greater weight on downward price pressures from changes in the supply-side of the economy, which would interact with and at least partly offset the inflationary pressures from strong domestic demand.##NewPara##The Governor invited members to vote on the proposition that the Bank s repo rate be maintained at .%. The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the proposition.##NewPara##Finally, on behalf of the Committee the Governor expressed his profound thanks to Willem Buiter and Charles Goodhart for their enormous contributions to establishing the MPC process and for the open-minded way in which they had participated in the Committee s discussions and decisions. On behalf of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Treasury representative expressed warm thanks for the contribution they had both made to establishing the credibility of the UK s new institutional framework for monetary policy.
