Regime dependence is factored into the contemporaneous covariance matrix and identified using an indicator of frictions in the government bond market. Average of results of four different identification schemes is shown. The individual schemes are: zero restrictions; sign restrictions; a combination of zero and sign restrictions; sign variance decomposition restrictions.
