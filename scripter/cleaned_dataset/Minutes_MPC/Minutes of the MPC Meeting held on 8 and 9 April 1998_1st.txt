Monetary developments and the implications of rising equity markets##NewPara##Indicators of both broad and narrow money growth had shown signs of slowing down. The twelve-month growth rate of M in March had fallen to .% from a recent peak of .% in July  and that of M had fallen to .% in March from a peak of .% the previous month. Estimates of Divisia money growth in Q would become available during April.##NewPara##M lending to Industrial and Commercial Companies (ICCs) had accelerated in January and February. Bank staff had raised the question of whether ICCs demand for credit was being driven by a need for working capital in the face of a slowdown in activity. The Committee concluded that supporting evidence for this hypothesis seemed to be weak as yet, but that it would be worth watching.##NewPara##Taken together, the money growth data over three months were consistent with a slower rate of growth of nominal income in the economy more widely, but were not conclusive. On the other hand, the evidence from share prices clearly went in the opposite direction. Not only had the FT-SE  index risen by a further % during March, but the upward movement had also been reflected in a wider variety of stocks than during , with similar rises in the FT-SE  and FT-SE Small Capitalisation indices. The increase in share prices over the previous twelve months or so had contributed to a significant rise in personal sector net financial wealth. The problem was to gauge the implications for consumption of the increase in wealth held in equities##NewPara##The size of the wealth effect on consumption from rising equity prices would depend, on a number of factors. Although direct share ownership had become more widespread, it was not clear whether this would lead to a weaker impact on consumption (if the large number of individuals with small holdings did not react) or to a stronger impact (if the gains were more widely perceived).##NewPara##The rise in equity markets was clearly a global phenomenon. The strength of UK markets was less marked than in countries such as the United States, Germany, Italy or Spain, although measurement in a common currency boosted the UK market s relative performance. A fall in real interest rates had occurred in most of these countries and probably contributed at least a part of the rise in equity prices. Corporate mergers in the United States may also have been an influence.##NewPara##The Committee concluded that the medium-term implications of the rise in the equity market would have to be addressed in the forecast for the May Inflation Report. Meanwhile the direction of the effect this month was to support consumption growth.##NewTopic##The further appreciation of sterling##NewPara##The exchange rate had appreciated over the month but had fallen back on the first day of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting leaving a net appreciation of % since the previous meeting. The initial appreciation in the month might have been partly a reaction to the Budget - which might have strengthened a perception of sound government policy in the United Kingdom - and partly arising from continuing uncertainty about monetary developments.##NewPara##The Committee debated whether some of the strength in sterling could be due to a re-rating of the UK economy. Market perceptions of the sustainable rate for sterling appeared to have strengthened, perhaps reflecting the United Kingdom s continuing strong economic performance. On one view, as a result, a greater proportion of sterling s appreciation might persist, and this would not necessarily have adverse effects on trade or output.##NewPara##It was also possible that uncertainty surrounding the future monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB) was contributing to the strength of sterling. In this case, although some uncertainty might be removed by the announcement of appointments to the executive board of the ECB, it was likely to be fully resolved only as the market learnt about the ECB s approach to setting interest rates from  onwards. The bond markets did not, however, seem to share any concerns about future European monetary policy: bond yields had generally fallen, converging on the lower German level. One possible explanation for different reactions in the foreign exchange and the bond markets was that the stability pact might have given credibility to expectations of tight fiscal policy in Europe   which might be balanced by looser monetary policy.##NewPara##Other influences related to the creation of the single currency could not be ruled out. One was the diversification motive   as the number of currencies was reduced, those seeking to spread their portfolio might be more inclined to buy sterling, along with other non-euro currencies.##NewPara##To the extent that the persistence of a high exchange rate was caused by these EMU-related factors then the short-run effect, via the impact on prices and net trade, would be broadly equivalent to a tightening of monetary conditions. It was therefore possible that downward pressures on inflation had been increased, without a further rise in interest rates.##NewPara##On a further possible view, the variation in sterling was just normal volatility and the most recent movement had been downwards. Such fluctuations were unlikely to have any significant impact.##NewTopic##Demand and output##NewPara##Retail sales fell in February but earlier erratic factors were making it difficult to assess the underlying trend. In particular, the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, had affected spending in September and October  and was still affecting estimates of the three-month growth rate.##NewPara##Seasonal adjustments over the Christmas period and record price discounting in January also made assessment difficult. There had been thirteen profit warnings from retailers since January  compared with three in the same period in . The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) Distributive Trades Survey for March showed a marked weakening in retail sales growth, but this survey could have been affected by the timing of Easter this year compared to last.##NewPara##Looking at other components of consumption, private car registrations data were buoyant in Q and the CBI Financial Services Survey was strong. Surveys of consumer confidence continued to show positive balances, although well below the historically high levels in mid- associated with the largest building society conversion payouts. Taking all the evidence together, consumption growth seemed likely to have remained robust in Q, but some of the indicators supported the February Inflation Report projection that, after a strong first quarter, consumption would decelerate over the course of .##NewPara##The Office for National Statistics (ONS) revisions to the composition of expenditure in  had brought the numbers more into line with what had been assumed for domestic demand growth for  in the February Inflation Report. However, the ONS estimate of the level of GDP in  had##NewPara##been revised down by .% and the level in Q by .%. This left the level of GDP below that assumed as the starting point for the Inflation Report projections.##NewPara##The path of GDP growth through  had also altered: it now looked smoother, with less##NewPara##pick-up in H and less slowdown in H. The growth rate in the fourth quarter was now estimated to have been . percentage points higher than previously, despite the downward revision to the estimated level in that quarter. Evidence on GDP growth in Q seemed to be consistent so far with the central projection in the February Inflation Report.##NewPara##The output measure of GDP in  H had been significantly depressed by the primary sectors - agriculture, energy extraction and supply - and the same might happen in  Q. The mild winter had led to weak energy demand. A measure of GDP which excluded these volatile sectors (which account for around % of GDP) showed growth continuing at above trend rates of around .% per quarter in  H. It was not obvious how to react to this divergence. Weak production in any sector affected incomes from that sector, and recent weaker earnings data were linked to lower overtime payments for workers in the utility industries. But to the extent that such fluctuations were due to temporary climatic factors, primary sector output was likely to return to normal, boosting GDP growth in due course.##NewPara##According to the ONS data, manufacturing output remained weak and continued to show a weaker picture than the majority of surveys. The monthly CBI and Chartered Industry of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) manufacturing surveys were stronger, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) quarterly survey less so. The CIPS survey even appeared to indicate a strengthening of manufacturing growth.##NewPara##The indicators of service sector output were more uniformly strong, despite the fact that elements of the service sector were exposed to the exchange rate appreciation, either directly through final demand or indirectly via services supplied to manufacturing. Details of the CIPS services survey suggested that the balance remained strong, with increased numbers reporting growth higher and increased numbers reporting a weakening. This suggested that the service sector was subject to diverse demand conditions in different sub-sectors. This more complicated picture was supported by the weaker surveys of retailing.##NewPara##Capacity utilisation measures for both services and manufacturing remained above average and##NewPara##robust, on both the CBI and BCC surveys. The strength of manufacturing output in the CBI survey seemed consistent with the capacity utilisation measures.##NewPara##Overall, the Committee considered that recent domestic activity data were broadly consistent with the February Inflation Report. Despite the remaining data puzzles, it was fairly clear that the externally exposed sectors of the economy were suffering while the less-exposed remained relatively buoyant.##NewPara##International news had shown the European economies continuing to recover slightly faster than previously expected and a robust US outlook, offset by a deteriorating Japanese conjuncture. The concern about a general financial crisis seemed to be receding. Recovery in Asia was now thought likely to take longer than earlier predictions but otherwise was not likely to be any more severe.##NewPara##Overall, there seemed to be little net change in demand conditions in UK export markets, although there was a general concern about the difficulties facing Japan.##NewTopic##The corporate sector##NewPara##The Committee discussed the combined evidence on the position of the corporate sector, which generally reacts to interest rate changes sooner than the household sector. One possible view was that the corporate position was weakening rather sharply. Manufacturing output was falling and exports were flat. M growth for ICCs had turned negative in the fourth quarter of , while M lending to ICCs had recently risen, which could indicate cash-flow problems. The National Accounts revisions showed a downward adjustment to gross profits of almost  bn in  and the ICCs  financial balance in  was negative for the first time since . Retailers  margins had started to fall as unit labour costs had picked up and the exchange rate was clearly squeezing manufacturing margins. One side-effect of the Asian crisis would be to reduce income from overseas operations, partly because of lower profits in foreign currency terms and partly because of a lower sterling value of those profits. Overall there were signs of a significant squeeze on the corporate sector, which could have greater knock-on consequences for investment and employment than are currently foreseen in the Inflation Report forecast.##NewPara##Counter to this was the continuing strength of the stock market to the extent that, in addition to the fall in real yields, it reflected expectations of strong future dividend growth. Furthermore, analysis of movements in import prices, unit labour costs and retail prices implied that a reduction in##NewPara##profits would be a necessary consequence of hitting the inflation target unless there were a fall back in unit labour cost growth.##NewTopic##The fiscal position##NewPara##The Committee had been given a short briefing on the provisional net fiscal effect of the Budget at the March MPC meeting, so there was relatively little news to the Committee on the fiscal position. The main issue for the Committee was the implication of the PSBR undershoot in /##NewPara##- equivalent to about % of GDP on current estimates - for domestic demand. It was not clear how much of the smaller PSBR was due to a higher effective tax rate and how much might indicate stronger than recorded activity in the past. If higher tax revenue was due to the introduction of self- assessment (and not just from the self-employed), some of the improvement was likely to be permanent. The unexpected strength of other components   such as VAT and corporation tax receipts - suggested stronger past expenditure or incomes. The expenditure undershoot in / was to be made up in / so this was a less important factor.##NewPara##On one view there had been a significant, and partly unanticipated tightening of fiscal policy in /, which would continue to affect aggregate demand in /. On another view, the fiscal outturn could be signalling the possibility of higher activity levels than had been recorded in past data.##NewPara##The March PSBR numbers would reveal whether the normal upsurge in government expenditure at the end of the financial year had happened.##NewTopic##Quantity versus price signals in the labour market##NewPara##The labour market data on quantities were signalling a tighter position than the price data. The Committee reviewed each in turn and the conclusions that could be drawn.##NewPara##Manufacturing employment showed a surprising rise of , in January and employment intentions indicated by the Manpower survey remained well above the long-term average. The BCC survey and the Bank s Agents recorded high and rising skill shortages. The C IPS surveys showed a##NewPara##flat trend for current manufacturing employment, but continuing strong growth in services employment.##NewPara##The claimant count measure of unemployment had continued to fall in , albeit more slowly than in . The Labour Force Survey (LFS) data due next month would be important additional evidence on this apparent moderation of the fall in unemployment. The LFS data should also help to reconcile the claimant unemployment and employment data.##NewPara##Price indicators gave less sign of a tightening labour market than the quantity data. Underlying average earnings growth for November and December had been revised down from   % to   % and the rate of earnings growth was estimated to have been stable at   % over the four months to January. Although earnings growth remained at a high level, the situation had not deteriorated as might have been expected from the quantity data. Several possible explanations were discussed.##NewPara##On one view it took time for labour market tightening to be reflected in earnings or settlements and recent growth in employment would feed through in due course. The Committee could not afford to wait for earnings to accelerate - that would mean reacting too late. In the late eighties earnings growth had not been an early indicator of the pick-up in inflation. One had to form a judgment about inflationary pressures and that meant forming a view about unobservable variables such as the natural rate of unemployment.##NewPara##On another view, it was significant that settlements had not picked up during the important New Year settlement period when lagged pressures from past labour market tightening might have been expected to be felt.##NewPara##An important question was how much the natural rate of unemployment might have fallen. The short-term unemployment rate was below the level seen during the late-eighties (at the peak of the previous cycle). Current quantity indicators would be extremely worrying if the natural rate had not fallen at all. Although earnings growth over the previous twelve months had been close to the Bank s forecast in the February  Inflation Report, unemployment had fallen faster than predicted, suggesting a more benign conjuncture, perhaps consistent with a lower natural rate of unemployment. It seemed likely that the long series of labour market reforms, particularly during the eighties, had led to a fall in the natural rate of unemployment, though it was difficult to identify what particular reforms could have caused it to fall during the last year.##NewPara##There was no reliable estimate of the natural rate of unemployment, but some Committee members placed greater weight on the survey data relating to skill shortages or recruitment difficulties as direct estimates of the balance of supply and demand in the labour market. These indicators suggested that the labour market was already very tight.##NewPara##The Committee went on to discuss a number of other factors which might be influencing the labour market. The appreciation of sterling might have been holding back earnings growth if labour markets were not fully integrated. As profits were squeezed in the externally exposed part of the economy so wage bargainers in those sectors would reflect this in settlements. If sterling s appreciation was expected to persist then this would result both in lower wage increases and in corporate re-structuring to improve labour productivity.##NewPara##Another contributing factor to the restraint of earnings growth might have been the lower settlements rate in the public sector. It was not clear how long this could persist. The competitive pressure raised by contracting out previously public sector work to private sector firms might be a restraining factor on some public sector pay deals. In this case differential growth rates of earnings might be sustained for some time. Contracting out to private companies   with lower levels of earnings but faster growth rates - might widen the recorded gap between private and public sector earnings growth.##NewPara##Shifts in employment patterns might also have contributed to a fall in the natural rate of unemployment. Employment in manufacturing had been flat or falling and there had been a huge shake-out in the privatised utilities. The rise in employment had come in the less unionised parts of the service sector. The move to more part-time and temporary jobs would also have been an influence. There was no longer any sign of large manufacturing companies - such as car manufacturers - setting a pay-round  norm . Services settlements tended to be more related to the firm s own profits and, in some cases, could be influenced more by public sector comparisons rather than by manufacturing settlements. And even in manufacturing, unions were now more aware of the competitive pressure on companies and anecdotal evidence reported that this was being reflected in negotiations.##NewPara##In the United States, the benign labour market conditions seemed to have been supported by strong productivity growth, especially in manufacturing. That may have reflected a lagged effect##NewPara##from new technology   especially Information Technology. In the United Kingdom there was no evidence yet of strong productivity growth. Indeed, weak measured productivity growth during the upswing implied higher unit labour costs.##NewPara##Finally, it was possible that the better-than-expected combination of unemployment and earnings reflected a fall in inflation expectations. This was consistent across various surveys, although the general public s inflation expectations were still significantly above the Bank s inflation target of  %.##NewPara##Taken together, the quantity signals appeared to indicate a tightening of the labour market and some surveys suggested that the tightening would continue. The problem was in judging where the natural rate of unemployment lay. On one view, the subdued behaviour of earnings was encouraging evidence that the natural rate of unemployment might be lower than had previously been thought, though this could be affected, as noted at the March MPC meeting, by the prospect of a National Minimum Wage.##NewTopic##Prices##NewPara##The news on prices remained benign. The oil price had fallen further and world commodity prices generally remained weak. UK producer price inflation was flat. Retail prices had been much as expected, showing a bounce back from January s record discounting.##NewPara##Looking forward, changes in petrol duties announced in the Budget and implemented immediately meant that the level of retail prices would be temporarily boosted by as much as##NewPara##. percentage points. This would remain in the twelve-month inflation figures from April to June, until the previous duty increase dropped out in July. In the interim it was possible that the RPIX inflation rate could reach % and the RPI inflation rate %. The Committee was clear that it should not try to offset such short-term fluctuations reflecting the timing of indirect tax changes associated with the fact that the  Budget was in March and the  Budget was in July. The MPC s inflation forecasts incorporated the Government s plans for increasing duties on alcohol and tobacco every year in real terms as detailed in previous Financial Statement and Budget Reports. The March Budget announcements on excise duties affected the expected timing of tax effects, but did not alter the Committee s views of the inflation rate in two years time.##NewTopic##The immediate policy decision##NewPara##The Committee started its discussions on the policy decision by reviewing the possible impact on financial markets of various choices. The markets were expecting no change this month with a small probability attached to an increase. A decision to leave rates unchanged might therefore have a small effect. It was thought that a rise would be a surprise to the markets but there were differing views as to the impact this would have on the exchange rate. A decision to cut would be regarded as a big surprise given the February Inflation Report and would require strong justification to be accepted as being consistent with the inflation target.##NewPara##Moving to the immediate question of whether to change rates this month, the economy appeared to be broadly on track with the central projection published in the February Inflation Report. The weakening of the net trade position seemed to be firmly established and the main issue had been the projected path of a slowdown in consumer demand after a robust first quarter. The available information on Q seemed to broadly support the projections. Quantity indicators of activity in the labour market and in the money data were also reasonably consistent with the central projection.##NewPara##The main news on the month concerned the continuing rise in share prices, the appreciation of the exchange rate, the implications of the Budget and the slightly better-than-expected earnings data.##NewPara##Given that the February Inflation Report suggested that it was more likely than not that interest rates would need to rise in order to hit the inflation target, on one view the arguments for an increase had not diminished. On this view, the economy was still operating at a level above that consistent with hitting the inflation target. Domestic demand was growing too rapidly to achieve the necessary slowdown in activity. Inflation had been temporarily depressed by the appreciation of the exchange rate but it ought to have fallen further. It was most likely that inflation would start rising once the effect of the appreciation wore off. The balance of risks was still on the upside and there remained particular risks from cumulative strong money growth and possible depreciation of the exchange##NewPara##On this view, the news on the month did not significantly alter the case for a rise in rates. The continuing rise in equity prices was likely to support robust consumption growth, even if the precise magnitude of its influence was unclear. The Budget had not contained much news for the Committee and the variation in the exchange rate was no more than usual month-to-month volatility. And to the extent that the rise in the exchange rate reflected an improvement in UK competitiveness##NewPara##or a shift in demand for UK goods, this would not have the effect of tightening monetary conditions. The quantity data and direct indicators all suggested that the labour market was continuing to tighten. On this view, if one waited for the earnings data to show signs of clear inflationary signals then the appropriate policy response would be delayed too long.##NewPara##Further evidence in favour of a rise in rates was the robust picture of GDP growth excluding the more variable primary sectors. In particular, to the extent that a mild winter had temporarily depressed (seasonally adjusted) energy output, a rebound would boost GDP growth in due course.##NewPara##An alternative view was that the need for a rise in rates had been offset by the news over the month. The further appreciation of the exchange rate could have delivered a tightening, possibly in excess of that yielded by a quarter percentage point rise in interest rates. And some members concluded that the Budget implied a tighter fiscal position - certainly for / and possibly spilling over into / - than perceived at the time of the February Inflation Report.##NewPara##In addition, the weaker-than-expected earnings growth had helped to offset concerns about inflationary pressures in the labour market, although earnings growth remained at a level which was only just consistent with hitting the inflation target. The upside risks to the central projection identified in the February Inflation Report had not so far materialised and leading activity indicators suggested that the expected slowing down of the economy was taking place. Furthermore, the level of GDP in  had been revised downwards so that any output gap above trend was less than previously thought.##NewPara##The central projection for inflation in the February Inflation Report had only just been above##NewPara##  %. On one possible view given subsequent developments, particularly the Budget and the rise in the exchange rate, a case could be made for a cut in interest rates to rebalance the overall policy setting. But the evidence on the pace of the domestic slowdown in demand was not yet sufficiently clear to persuade any members of the Committee to advocate a cut this month.##NewPara##Members discussed the timing of any interest rate move. On one view it was a bad time to raise rates. Sterling was strong, creating an unbalanced economy, and this would be exacerbated by a further move now. Retail prices would show a spike from excise duties in the second quarter and the RPI would be further boosted by a rate rise now. The February Inflation Report central projection was for growth in the UK economy to slow during . Against this background and given current##NewPara##projections, it could be argued that the costs of waiting a few months, in terms of any additional tightening that proved necessary, would be small. Finally, the May Inflation Report round was just about to start and that would provide a fresh opportunity to assess medium-term inflationary pressures and the attendant risks.##NewPara##An alternative view in favour of an immediate rise was that the data were broadly confirming the outlook published in the February Report and that a failure to move sufficiently rapidly would require a larger correction in due course - perhaps at a time when growth in the economy was already slowing. On this view, the cost of reversing policy, should that prove necessary, would simply be to accelerate the return to a sustainable growth path. It was also possible to argue that a delayed increase could add more to the imbalance in the economy than an immediate move.##NewPara##The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank s repo rate be left unchanged this month. Five members of the Committee (the Governor,##NewPara##David Clementi, Charles Goodhart, DeAnne Julius and Ian Plenderleith) voted for the proposition and three (Alan Budd, Willem Buiter and Mervyn King) voted against, preferring an immediate increase in interest rates.
