The world economy##NewPara##The main developments in the world economy since the previous meeting had been the financial and political crisis in Russia and the continued deterioration of the outlook for growth in Japan. The Committee considered the direct trade linkages with Russia, the implications of changes in capital flows, the reaction in world equity, bond and money markets, the likely impact of weak commodity prices   especially for oil   and the outlook for world growth.##NewPara##Looking at the direct effects on trade it was clear that Russia on its own would have a relatively small impact via trade linkages, accounting for just .% of UK exports compared with .% going to Latin America and .% to Asia (excluding Japan). Following the unilateral restructuring of Russian debt there had been a sharp reaction in world financial markets. In particular there had been a global widening of spreads on corporate debt over risk-free assets, including for industrialised world companies exposed to the emerging market economies, which had raised the cost of capital. There had also been a large increase in bond yields for emerging-market sovereign debt. This would make it more difficult for those countries to finance external deficits and to refinance maturing debt. To ward off the threat of contagion, the policy response in a number of these countries had been to tighten monetary and fiscal policy, with deflationary implications for the world economy.##NewPara##Capital flows to the emerging market economies were thought to have largely come to a halt. In the short-run the Committee thought that this could put pressure on the exchange rate pegs of a number of countries, causing further financial instability. Assuming that the change in capital flows persisted, there would have to be a corresponding re-balancing of trade flows, with smaller deficits/larger surpluses in emerging market economies and bigger deficits/smaller surpluses in the industrialised world. This in turn would require a higher real exchange rate relative to the currencies of the emerging market economies.##NewPara##The Committee noted that, unfortunately, the industrialised countries were not well placed to expand demand appropriately. Ideally the largest increases in demand would come in Japan and then continental Europe, with less change in the United States and the United Kingdom which were already experiencing strong domestic demand and increasing trade deficits. In Japan   which had cut interest rates on the first day of the meeting ( September), guiding call money rates down by  basis points to just .%   little progress had as yet been made in restructuring the financial system and achieving sustained growth in domestic demand. In continental Europe, attention was focussed on the introduction of the single currency. National fiscal policy would be constrained by the Stability and Growth Pact, which might make any immediate expansionary policy response problematic.##NewPara##In consequence, the Committee thought it was likely that the US and UK trade deficits would have to bear a large share of the burden, and that this could have exchange rate consequences. If the US and UK trade deficits continued to get larger, then the dollar and sterling effective rates could come under pressure, despite appreciating against the currencies of emerging market economies.##NewPara##The dollar had already weakened significantly. The sterling effective exchange rate had appreciated sharply immediately following the Russian crisis, to reach a peak of ., but had fallen back to##NewPara##. by the start of the Committee s meeting.##NewPara##The financial market reaction had included a fall in the major world equity markets of %-%, and the FT-SE  index had fallen by around %. Committee members suggested that, in the aftermath of such events, it could be difficult for markets to establish new equilibrium prices, either for equities or for currencies. Consistent with this, there had been a marked increase in the volatility of asset prices. The Committee also considered that there might yet be further adjustment downwards in world equity markets, especially since price-to-earnings ratios remained high.##NewPara##Market interest rates in the industrialised countries had fallen, consistent with a fall in expected future rates. This might indicate a degree of monetary easing. The expected starting level of official rates in the Euro-area, implied by future rates, had fallen from around  % to .% (the current level of official rates in France and Germany). In the United Kingdom, actual money market rates had fallen by one eighth of a percentage point for one-month London inter-bank rates, by one quarter of a percentage point on three-month rates and by half of one percentage point on twelve- month rates. Bond yields over one year had also fallen by up to half a percentage point.##NewPara##One particular consequence of recent events was that world commodity prices were likely to remain weak, especially for oil. This in turn would put financial pressure on oil-producing countries at a time when OPEC was already struggling to agree reduced production levels. A reduction in oil and other commodity prices would constitute a change in the terms of trade, redistributing demand to the importers. It would also have favourable supply-side effects on employment and capital##NewPara##formation. In the medium-run this would be beneficial to world growth. However, based on what had happened when oil prices fell in , the initial effect could be to weaken world growth if, as then, demand fell faster in the oil exporting countries than it rose in the importing countries.##NewPara##The Committee considered the impact of all these developments on the outlook for world output and prices. Within the last month forecasts for Japanese output growth in  and  had been revised down substantially and forecasts for other G economies were also being revised down for . The Committee agreed that weaker world demand growth would result in excess capacity. These conditions of excess supply should result in lower world inflation.##NewTopic##The policy implication of external developments##NewPara##The Committee discussed its reaction to an internationally co-ordinated monetary policy response, should such a proposal emerge. The Committee would consider changing interest rates if that were consistent with pursuit of the domestic inflation target.##NewPara##It was not clear, however, that a co-ordinated monetary easing was the appropriate policy response in current circumstances. On one possible view, the current crises in emerging market economies reflected problems originating within those economies and were not caused by excessively tight monetary polices in the industrialised economies. Although faster demand growth in, say, the OECD countries might help alleviate some of the symptoms, it would not solve the fundamental problems in Russia. And any plausible changes in policy rates would be small relative to the rise in spreads engendered by the crisis. Another possible view held that the magnitude of the spreads might not be independent of the level of interest rates in the main industrial countries. A monetary relaxation could then be rather more effective.##NewPara##The Committee noted that the different cyclical and structural situations in Japan, continental Europe, the United States and the United Kingdom would make a differentiated response more appropriate. For some countries an appropriate monetary easing might be to increase rates by less than previously thought likely, whereas for others it might be more appropriate to cut.##NewTopic##Domestic output and business surveys##NewPara##The official GDP data for the second quarter and industrial production data for July were broadly in line with the central projection for output growth in the August Inflation Report. But the Committee noted that business surveys, particularly of manufacturing, had been weak for the second month running. Staff analysis of the surveys   matching the balances to actual growth rates - gave a mixed picture. Some survey data   such as expectations reported in the British Chambers of Commerce survey carried out in Q   had been broadly consistent with continuing flat##NewPara##manufacturing output growth in Q and with services growth declining from strong rates, but still positive. In contrast some survey data   notably the CBI industrial trends survey and the C IPS (Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply) survey of manufacturing   clearly indicated negative manufacturing growth in the third quarter. In this context the July figures for manufacturing output##NewPara##  showing growth of .% on the month   supported a somewhat firmer picture.##NewPara##The Committee felt that the evidence was consistent with its central expectation of a further modest slowdown in output growth in the third quarter, with growth overall likely to remain positive. However, the Committee noted the weaker CBI evidence and also recalled the experience of  when the official data released up to the Autumn gave little indication of the imminent sharp fall in output. The balance of risks to the short-run outlook for output remained on the downside.##NewPara##The weaker surveys and the official data could be reconciled if it were the case that there was an unplanned build-up in stocks, delaying the reduction in actual output. The Committee noted that stockbuilding had made a third successive positive contribution to growth in the second quarter.##NewPara##The Committee decided to ask the Agents to investigate further what was happening to stock levels.##NewPara##The Committee considered the growing evidence that the projected slowdown in demand growth was also materialising. The Q data suggested that domestic demand was slightly stronger than projected in the August Inflation Report, but this was entirely accounted for by stockbuilding. For Q the main indicators of demand were for retail sales, cars, consumer confidence and the housing market.##NewPara##The British Retail Consortium data for August had indicated a continuing slowdown in annual retail sales growth, although quarterly changes in retail sales might be erratically strong after a weak second quarter. The CBI Distributive Trades survey for August was consistent with a slowing growth rate in retail sales. Some members of the Committee thought that the survey was not quite as weak as it might have been, given the weak expectations for August recorded in the July survey. Car registrations had been erratically weak in Q and the staff had indicated that there was likely to be some rebound in growth in Q, but the CBI Distributive Trades survey indicated a weak August for the motor trades.##NewPara##Consumer confidence had been weakening. The Committee noted that the deterioration was in large part due to sentiment about the general economic situation rather than respondents  own financial positions. The housing market was also giving mixed signals but house prices were no longer accelerating and had fallen in August according to both the Nationwide and Halifax indices. Surprisingly, the net mortgage lending data had risen strongly in July but no firm conclusions could be drawn from one month s numbers.##NewPara##Taking all the demand indicators together, the Committee concluded that there was evidence of continuing underlying slowdown in the third quarter.##NewTopic##Earnings growth##NewPara##The labour market data for June had been somewhat surprising for both quantities and prices. Despite the slowdown in output growth, unemployment was continuing to fall on both the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and claimant count measures and the decline in LFS unemployment had been greater in the second quarter than the first. According to the LFS, employment was rising less quickly than unemployment was falling. The difference was explained by an increasing number of people becoming inactive. The latest Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services survey indicated that the labour market was continuing to tighten, albeit at a slower pace than earlier in the year. This picture was supported by the reports of the Bank s regional Agents.##NewPara##In the context of an otherwise tightening labour market, a significant slowing in the annual growth rate of earnings had been surprising. The twelve-month rate had fallen to .% in June from .% in May. Within the total the growth of the  irregular  pay component had been expected to fall back, and had done so, but the regular pay component had also fallen from .% in May to .% in June. Furthermore, the fall had occurred equally in both manufacturing and services. On the other hand, public sector pay growth had risen to .%, sharply reducing the difference between private and public sector growth rates. And data on settlements continued to show an upwards trend.##NewPara##There was no evidence that the earnings figures were being distorted by special factors but the Committee could not place too much weight on one month s figures. If further data confirmed a slowdown in earnings growth, that would be good news in terms of lower domestically generated inflationary pressure.##NewTopic##Monetary growth##NewPara##The growth of broad money had been slowing during , giving some support to the projection of a slowdown in nominal demand growth. But aggregate M growth had risen to .% in the twelve-months to July from .% in June. It was possible that these two months had been affected by seasonal distortions, but even taken together, the picture of a slowdown was weakened.##NewPara##Narrow money growth had also picked up, with M growth rising from .% in the twelve months to July to .% in August. Although Notes and Coin growth rose by just . to .%, both figures gave less support for an underlying slowdown in nominal demand growth.##NewPara##As with the earnings data, the Committee could not place much weight on one month s figures. In this case, if further data confirmed strong rates of money growth, that would be bad news in terms of inflationary pressures (in the absence of a decline in velocity).##NewTopic##Retail Prices##NewPara##The Committee briefly reviewed the evidence on retail prices. Having peaked at .% in May, affected by tax effects and other erratic factors, it was comforting that RPIX inflation had fallen back to .% by July, only just above the target of .%. Staff estimates of the short-run influences on RPIX components suggested that inflation might be slightly lower over the next few months than projected in the August Inflation Report.##NewTopic##Consequences for the Committee’s inflation and output projections##NewPara##The Committee concluded that there had been relatively little in the data on the domestic economy that would change its projections. Demand and output growth seemed to be slowing in line with the August central projection although the risk of a faster slowdown had increased. The data on earnings would be good news for inflation prospects if sustained in the coming months, while continuing strong money supply data would be adverse.##NewPara##In its evaluation of external developments it was clear to the Committee that there had been an increase in the downside risks to world activity, principally arising from the recent and possible future contagion of financial market crises in emerging market economies. Taking external and domestic factors together the balance of risks to inflation, which had been on the upside at the time of the August Inflation Report, had shifted towards the downside.##NewPara##The Committee also concluded that the degree of uncertainty surrounding future world prospects had risen and this had been seen in increased market volatility.##NewPara##The Committee further agreed that its expectations for world growth and inflation were now lower than at the time of the August Inflation Report. However, there was a range of views over whether developments so far should lead to any substantial change as yet in the central projection for UK inflation.##NewPara##On one view, world events so far should cause only a small change to the central projection for UK inflation. Although it was possible to imagine any number of downside scenarios for the world economy, the Committee should not assume that the most extreme outcome was the central case. The most important economies for world activity and for UK exports remained the United States, continental Europe and Japan. Growth remained robust in the United States and domestic demand##NewPara##had been strengthening in the major EU economies, although the pace of expansion had been variable. Japan had weakened further. The Russian crisis and the widespread fall in equity prices were evidence that some of the downside risks identified earlier were now coming to pass but most of the concern over emerging market economies was in relation to possible future events rather than actual outcomes. And sterling had weakened since the August MPC meeting. Hence the central projection had shifted by less than the balance of risks.##NewPara##On another view there had been a significant increase in excess world supply, which would lead to a prolonged deflationary effect on the world economy. The major world equity markets still had high price-to-earnings ratios and more price adjustment was likely. It was also possible that domestic activity was weakening faster than projected in August, under the influence of high interest rates and a strong exchange rate. On this view, recent external developments reinforced earlier concerns that inflation might undershoot the target and the central projection should be revised down by more.##NewTopic##The immediate policy decision##NewPara##The Committee agreed that there had been a marked shift in its position since the August meeting. The balance of risks for its projection of UK inflation had been on the upside in the August Inflation Report and that balance had since shifted towards the downside, largely reflecting international developments. One consequence of these developments had been some correction in equity prices, but these still seemed high and a more significant adjustment might yet occur.##NewPara##The out-turns for domestic data had been much as the Committee had expected, although there was common concern over the weaker signals from business surveys and a welcoming of the weaker data on earnings growth. There was broad agreement that the risks had at least shifted sufficiently to remove the balance on the upside of the August central projection of inflation. The discussion concentrated on whether there was a sufficient case yet for rates to be cut immediately, taking into account all the relevant external and domestic considerations.##NewPara##On one view, the factors determining the central projection had not yet shifted sufficiently to justify a change in rates. If the forecast were to be revised, the balance of risks would clearly have shifted towards the downside and the  hump  shape in the inflation projection for  might be less marked, but any change in the central projection for inflation in the medium-term would be small. And the balance of risks might alter if rates were cut at the wrong moment. In particular, an early cut, which the markets might well take as indicating a change in the direction of rates, could lead to a sharp fall in sterling, which might more than offset the increased downside pressures on inflation from weaker world output and inflation. All Committee members nevertheless acknowledged the increased downside risks to the world economy and the possibility that domestic growth could be##NewPara##slowing more quickly than projected and indicated a willingness to move quickly should either possibility prove to be the case.##NewPara##On a second view, although the outturns for official data on domestic activity were broadly as expected, business surveys were very weak for the second consecutive month, the equity market had come off the top and the correction might still have a long way to go. The change in the world outlook was also significant news. Taking these factors together there was sufficient evidence already to shift the central projection for UK inflation from above the target to below. On this basis, rates should now be cut by  basis points.##NewPara##On a third view, there had already been a danger of undershooting the inflation target and the previous case for a cut in rates was reinforced. The full extent and timing of the reduction would be a matter of tactics but it should start immediately. Even after interest rates started to fall, sterling would be subject to upwards as well as downwards pressure, given the relative strength of the UK economy and investors seeking a safe haven from world events.##NewPara##The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank s repo rate be maintained at .% this month. Seven members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King, David Clementi, Alan Budd, Charles Goodhart, Ian Plenderleith and John Vickers) voted for the proposition, and two (Willem Buiter and DeAnne Julius) voted against, preferring an immediate cut in interest rates.##NewPara##After reaching its decision, the Committee decided to make a statement to reflect the shared view that, despite no change in interest rates, the balance of risks had nevertheless shifted since the August meeting.
