The world economy##NewPara##The Committee discussed whether the prospects for the world economy had improved over the past month. In the United States, domestic demand in particular had continued to grow strongly, with little sign yet of any slowdown in growth or any pick-up in inflation. Supply side developments in the United States appeared to be more favourable than in the euro area, although in several European countries output remained below potential. Growth was sluggish and industrial sentiment weak, particularly in Germany.  Meanwhile expectations had grown of a reduction in interest rates by the European Central Bank (ECB). In Japan, the Nikkei had recovered strongly in the last few weeks of the financial year, with buying from foreign investors amid signs of a higher probability of corporate restructuring. But any recovery in business sentiment had been muted - and might be reversed - while consumer confidence could be further damaged by record levels of unemployment.##NewPara##Outside the major industrial countries, spreads on emerging market sovereign dollar debt - as measured by J P Morgan - had fallen by over  basis points during the month. Sentiment - and in some cases activity - was a little stronger in East Asia and Latin America, where some countries had benefited from higher oil prices. The markets appeared to have discounted a deterioration in prospects in Russia. So in general, developments in the world economy seemed much as expected in the February Inflation Report, although the downside risks to activity might have diminished somewhat. A major uncertainty was over the events in Kosovo, where the effects on consumer and business confidence elsewhere, and on the budgetary positions of the NATO countries, were not yet clear.##NewPara##There were some signs that commodity prices had begun to bottom out, and oil prices had risen sharply as a result of agreed cutbacks in supply. While it was too soon to judge whether these increases would persist, the cutbacks appeared to have greater credibility in the market than had##NewPara##sometimes been the case. The downward pressure on world prices from oil and other commodities might therefore be less than in the recent past. But with most economies outside the United States below productive capacity, the scope for a generalised pick-up in inflation was limited.##NewTopic##The exchange rate, money and credit##NewPara##For most of the month sterling had been stronger than at the time of the previous meeting of the Committee, particularly against the euro, although it had weakened a little in recent days. But the effective exchange rate index remained over % higher than implied by the central projection in the February Inflation Report. Many possible explanations had been advanced for sterling s strength, and discussed by the Committee in this as in previous meetings. If this strength in the exchange rate were sustained, it would tend to dampen inflation, and also activity in the internationally traded sectors of the economy.##NewPara##So far as money was concerned, growth rates for M had continued to slow, as expected, with a sharp decrease in the contribution from other financial corporations (OFCs). Growth in M lending had also slowed further.##NewTopic##Demand and output##NewPara##The Committee discussed the revisions made to the estimates of the level and composition of GDP for  and . Since the February Inflation Report, the estimated level of GDP at market prices in  Q had been reduced by   %, although by only   % when measured at basic prices. This had consequences for measures of the output gap and labour productivity. The implications for future price developments were unclear. On one interpretation, this implied that there was less pressure on capacity and that, given the lags involved, the effects of slower GDP growth had yet to feed through fully into lower inflation. On an alternative view, it suggested a less favourable##NewPara##short-run trade-off between activity and inflation; inflation was unchanged and either capacity utilisation was lower, core inflation higher or estimates of capacity had been reduced. But the size of the changes had not been large, and it was not clear on either view how much significance should be attached to this.##NewPara##Estimates for the growth of GDP in  Q had also been revised downwards, to .% over the previous quarter. Within this total, the weakest demand components had been government##NewPara##consumption and net trade. In contrast private consumption and investment had been revised up, significantly so in the case of business investment. At the same time, the downwards revision to inventories suggested that the risks of a significant stock cycle in  had diminished, particularly since stocks held by manufacturers and retailers appeared under control. This interpretation was in line with earlier survey evidence for these sectors. But because of the downwards revision to the level of GDP, the estimated stock-output ratio was little changed.##NewPara##Retail sales volumes had declined in February, and on a three month average had been only % above the levels of a year earlier. But the CBI distributive trades survey suggested that a trough might have been reached, and spending on services, which was not included in retail sales, had continued to grow faster than spending on goods. The GfK consumer confidence index was now positive for the first time in nine months. When taken together with other information on consumer spending, the data appeared in line with the Inflation Report projections for consumption in the first quarter of .##NewPara##The Committee considered the prospects for investment. The financial deficit of the private non-financial corporations (PNFCs) had widened to % of GDP, the highest level since . This might in part reflect the growth of business investment in the second half of . The increase##NewPara##appeared to have been most marked in the services sector, and might represent a bringing forward of IT-related spending ahead of the millennium. The millennium might also boost spending on construction this year, with signs, perhaps, that next year would be less buoyant. All this might have implications for the profile of activity over the next two years. But work by Bank staff suggested that movements in the credit and money holdings of the PNFCs were consistent both with the recent strength of investment, and continued growth in .##NewPara##The Committee agreed that the Budget contained little that altered the outlook for inflation. At its previous meeting it had decided that the figures for the overall fiscal position, on which the Committee had been briefed, were in line with the assumptions made in the February Inflation Report. Following the Budget itself, an analysis of the implications of the detailed measures for the composition of demand suggested that these should not have a significant additional effect on the prospects for activity and inflation over the forecast period.##NewPara##Forward-looking survey evidence continued to suggest an improvement (from a low base) in business confidence in all sectors of the economy. But official data and that from surveys indicated##NewPara##that manufacturing output was still declining, and information from the Bank s regional Agents suggested that in this sector in particular, confidence remained fragile. By contrast, the CIPS index for services output had risen above , indicating growth rather than contraction, for the first time since October. The sharp fall seen in the second half of  might have been partly in response to events in financial markets at that time. A recovery in confidence had therefore been expected, with the readings now consistent with the central projection for output in  contained in the February Inflation Report. The CIPS survey for construction had also strengthened, in line with other indicators for that sector.##NewPara##All in all, the data suggested that the prospects for activity were little different from those expected at the time of the February Inflation Report. The downwards revision to the level of GDP had been interpreted by some commentators as reducing inflationary pressures, but the size of the revision of GDP measured at basic prices was small, and the implications for inflation ambiguous. At the same time, significant changes had been made to the composition of demand, particularly to investment and stockbuilding. While the recovery in business confidence had yet to be reflected in official figures, this was to be expected given the lags involved.##NewTopic##The housing market##NewPara##There had been a sharp increase in the Halifax and Nationwide house price indices in March. Data from the House Builders Federation on net reservations and site visits, together with figures on loan approvals and particulars delivered, suggested that turnover in the housing market had risen.##NewPara##The increase had followed a sharp fall towards the end of , and the turnaround might have been influenced by the fall in interest rates since October.##NewTopic##The labour market##NewPara##Employment had continued to rise, with the LFS measure increasing by , in the last three months. However, much of this increase had been in part-time employment, and on a full time equivalent basis the increase had probably been closer to ,. Total hours worked had fallen, and the unemployment rate had risen. The effects of this on consumer confidence may not yet have been seen. The surveys were mixed; while some suggested a sharp downturn in the demand for labour, with the Manpower survey showing the weakest job prospects since , the C IPS employment index had risen slightly, but remained below .##NewPara##The latest data for average earnings growth continued the fall seen since the new series was released. The headline figure had reached .% in December. This decline was linked to a reduction in hours worked per head, and to a negative contribution from bonuses.##NewPara##Data on settlements also indicated a decline in nominal wage pressures, although inflation expectations appeared to have fallen by even more. The decline in settlements was not yet apparent from the headline twelve month figures, but for a matched sample of firms from the Bank s database, settlements this year were running at .% in January and February, as against % the previous year.##NewTopic##Prices##NewPara##The implications of a reduction in earnings growth for inflation would depend on a variety of factors, including developments in productivity, margins and import prices. Productivity growth over the past three years had been below its  year average. It was difficult to know how much weight to attach to observed productivity growth over such a short period. But relatively small differences in assumptions about productivity could have a material effect on the projections for inflation over the next two years. More generally, the pass-through from unit labour costs to prices was not straightforward. It would depend, among other things, on cyclical conditions and on other input prices. These issues would be looked at again in the forthcoming Inflation Report round.##NewPara##Oil prices were much higher than a month ago, although some rise had already been assumed in the central projection in the February Inflation Report. These increases would exert some upwards pressure on input prices, particularly since the falls in non-oil commodity prices might be coming to an end. Depending on the path of the exchange rate, domestic inflationary pressures might come more to the fore in determining the path of RPIX, even if competition from imports remained intense. On the other hand, the recent falls in non-oil commodity prices had been steeper than expected, and the exchange rate had strengthened. The balance between domestic and international inflationary pressures would be examined in the context of the next Inflation Report.##NewPara##The most recent figure for RPIX inflation - at .% - had been below the target for the first time since the Committee had been established. This had been despite some strength in the price of seasonal foods, which might unwind in coming months. But the difference from the .% target was very small, and of little relevance to the prospects for inflation two years ahead. Next month it was very likely that RPIX inflation would be above target as a result of the timing of Budget measures,##NewPara##which would affect petrol prices in March as compared with April last year. But this effect would last for only a month, and should have no implications for inflation in two years  time.##NewTopic##Tactical considerations##NewPara##The Committee noted that a reduction in rates was widely expected this month, although rather less universally than had been the case a week earlier. There was also a growing feeling in the market that the ECB might reduce its rates later that day. Should either factor influence the Committee s thinking?##NewPara##It was possible that a decision to leave interest rates unchanged would be interpreted as a signal that current levels would be the trough of this interest rate cycle. It was also possible that a similar conclusion might be reached from an unexpectedly large reduction in rates. Given that any decision was open to misinterpretation, the Committee agreed that this was not a factor which it would take into account.##NewPara##There was also the issue of the exchange rate. While this was little changed from its level at the time of the previous meeting, its strength against the euro continued to surprise many observers. But the reaction of sterling to any change in UK interest rates was unclear.##NewTopic##The immediate policy decision##NewPara##Over the past month, there had been further revisions to the level and composition of GDP, a continuing recovery in survey data from the low points reached in the latter part of , and some easing in labour market pressures, including lower settlements and earnings growth. This was against the backdrop of a world economy in which some of the downside risks had diminished, oil prices had risen sharply, and the exchange rate was over % higher than assumed in the February Inflation Report.##NewPara##Given this background the Committee discussed the case for no change to rates, a reduction of  basis points, and a reduction of  basis points.##NewPara##The Committee considered various developments which could have suggested leaving rates unchanged this month. The prospects for activity were much as expected, with some signs that past reductions in interest rates were beginning to sustain activity. The changes to the composition of##NewPara##demand were at least as important as the downwards revision to GDP, and suggested that the downside risks to output from a stock cycle or weak investment during  were less now than previously thought. Financial wealth had risen, with share prices up further during the month and the housing market showing signs of recovery. Survey measures of confidence had also recovered somewhat. Overall, the evidence appeared consistent with positive, if slow, growth in GDP during the rest of this year, as set out in the central projection of the February Inflation Report. And while there were signs that labour market pressures had begun to ease, the evidence was not conclusive (for example on earnings per hour) and the link between this and prices required further analysis.##NewPara##Finally, oil prices were sharply higher.##NewPara##But other developments pointed to the need for a further reduction in interest rates. The effective exchange rate had been stronger throughout most of the previous month. Earnings growth seemed to be lower than expected, a view supported by information on settlements, although assessing the implications of this for prices required more work. Finally, confidence, although improved, probably remained fragile. With a reduction in interest rates widely expected a decision to maintain rates at their current levels could be seen as a policy tightening, which might have an unnecessarily damaging effect on confidence and activity.##NewPara##The previous month several members had felt that not much additional news would be required to justify a further reduction in rates. They took the view that the balance of evidence since then supported a reduction in interest rates this month. While the prospects for activity were little changed over the month, the risks to the inflation outlook had shifted somewhat to the downside. It was therefore appropriate to reduce rates by  basis points in order to meet the inflation target.##NewPara##Another view which favoured an immediate reduction in the repo rate of  basis points was that there was a growing risk that the inflation target would be undershot, given the lags between output and inflation, the intensity of price competition from overseas and the deceleration seen in settlements and earnings. Short-term inflation expectations as measured by surveys had declined, and might fall further given the sharp decline in the RPI measure of inflation. The size of the PNFC deficit was a concern, and the growth in investment might well be a temporary pre-millennium effect. Finally, the intensifying Balkans conflict increased the downside risks of a further blow to confidence in the global economy. It was therefore necessary to keep interest rates on a downwards path, and a reduction in rates of  basis points this month was appropriate.##NewPara##Another view was that in March, a reduction of  basis points had been required. Since then the revisions to GDP had contained little news, although given the underspend in , it was possible that government final demand might increase by less than planned. With price developments favourable, and the future earnings profile likely to be below that contained in the February Inflation Report, it was preferable to reduce the repo rate by  basis points now, in order to prevent inflation falling below the target and to underpin activity.##NewPara##The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank s repo rate be reduced by  basis points to .%. Eight members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King, David Clementi, Alan Budd, Charles Goodhart, DeAnne Julius, Ian Plenderleith and John Vickers) voted for the proposition. Willem Buiter voted against, preferring a reduction of  basis points.##NewPara##The following members of the Committee were present.
