The prospects for global activity and prices##NewPara##A key issue remained how much of a depressing influence the international economy would have on the domestic economy, and hence on the prospects for UK inflation. The outlook for the world economy had clearly deteriorated over recent months, and this had been a material factor in the Committee s decisions to reduce rates in October, November and December. Views varied on whether there had been much sign of a further international deterioration over the past month, or whether international developments had principally reflected the continuing pass-through and unwinding of previous negative shocks to demand in the world economy.##NewPara##Some outside forecasts of world trade were being revised down further   for example, the IMF had updated its WEO projections in December. The latest Consensus Economics survey showed that forecasts for Germany and other euro-area economies had been revised down in December. Over the past month business confidence in the euro area had continued to weaken. The Japanese economy continued to deteriorate. The Tankan survey had weakened further, returning to the very low level recorded in . The latest indicators for the United States continued to be quite strong, and the Consensus Economics survey showed that some growth forecasts for  had been revised up in December. It was also necessary to take account of the easing of policy in the United States and in the euro area since the autumn and the effects were unlikely to have been seen in the official data yet. Overall, the situation in the major industrial countries was not obviously worse than a month ago, but was no better than expected.##NewPara##Some of the forward-looking indicators in the United States   such as the National Association of Purchasing Managers index   were a little weaker. This weakening, in common with that in other OECD countries, perhaps related more to the manufacturing rather than service sectors of the economy. Though it seemed likely that robust US growth would continue over the next two or three quarters, there was a risk of a substantial slowdown looking further ahead. One possibility was a weakening of demand, if for example there were an adjustment of equity prices; another##NewPara##possibility was that supply constraints would begin to slow growth, although there were few signs of that in the current price and cost data.##NewPara##Non-oil commodity prices had risen slightly in November, following the fall in the previous month. But despite the military action in the Gulf, the fall in world oil prices to around $ per barrel that had occurred prior to the December meeting had largely persisted. For the world as a whole there had been a negative shock to aggregate demand following the crisis in East Asia and the Russian financial problems, so that it was likely that demand had fallen further below capacity, putting downward pressure on world prices and possibly real interest rates. Commodity prices had been especially sensitive to this shock. For the United Kingdom, goods price inflation excluding taxes was currently running significantly below aggregate RPIX inflation, given falls in the price of tradeables and the effect of past tax increases.##NewPara##The external environment would be a key consideration in the quarterly Inflation Report forecast round. The risks to both inflation and real activity remained clearly on the downside, and might have increased. The Committee discussed the risks and possible ramifications of further serious problems in emerging market economies, and agreed that policy could react if these downside risks materialised.##NewTopic##Exchange rates and financial markets##NewPara##The sterling effective exchange rate had appreciated a little prior to Christmas, but had depreciated slightly at the turn of the year. The Bank had monitored the introduction of the euro, which had gone smoothly, and the Committee agreed that this did not, for the time being, have any material implications for the outlook for inflation and the conduct of monetary policy in the United Kingdom.##NewPara##The yield on index-linked government debt had continued to fall, and was now around % at a maturity of ten years. Real yields were now at their lowest level since such bonds were introduced in the United Kingdom in . Regulatory changes for pension funds that came into force in April  - namely the minimum funding requirement - may have made it more attractive for them to hold index-linked debt relative to some other assets. But the effects of these changes were likely to be spread over a number of years following the initial announcement, and it seemed unlikely that this could explain the very recent fall in UK real yields. There had been a corresponding fall in long-term nominal yields: implied inflation expectations remained broadly unchanged over the recent past. It was not clear what had caused the fall in UK long-term real interest rates, and therefore what the consequences would be for the economy. Although it was difficult to explain the fall in long-term real yields in the United Kingdom relative to overseas, it was noted that there had been a general decline in global real yields over the past year. One possible explanation of the##NewPara##most recent fall was linked to the downward shock to world demand, which might imply a reduction in the real rate of interest that would balance global saving and investment.##NewPara##Most major international stock markets had risen over the past month, and the F T-SE All-Share index was % above the level assumed in the November Inflation Report central projection. It was difficult to explain fully the rise in equity prices, but it was possible that it was related to the fall in real interest rates.##NewPara##The spreads of yields on UK corporate bonds over government bond yields remained higher than they had been prior to the shocks of summer . But the level of nominal yields on these bonds had fallen over the same period.##NewTopic##Money and credit##NewPara##The growth rate of notes and coin had been robust through the autumn, even after adjusting for the introduction of the   coin. This added weight to the picture painted by the official retail sales figures, which had been stronger than much of the survey evidence had suggested. The provisional December figure for notes and coin had been particularly strong, but this could not sensibly be assessed in isolation because of the uncertainty surrounding the seasonal adjustment to the Christmas month figures.##NewPara##Aggregate M growth had slowed in November, and had been matched by slower growth of lending. The slowdown in the growth of M and M lending was in large part accounted for by a reduction in the stocks of deposits and outstanding loans held by other financial corporations (OFCs). Within OFCs there had been anecdotal evidence that securities dealers, in particular, had been contracting their balance sheets by more than normal towards the end of . This was consistent with some of the data (for example, the fall in sterling lending by the major British banks to securities dealers).##NewPara##Overall, some members thought that the latest monetary data were consistent with a gradual slowing of demand.##NewPara##Lending to households continued to be robust, and had grown by  % in the year to November. This did not seem to be significantly out of line with nominal consumption growth. However, the high rate of increase in the smaller non-secured component of lending (which accounted for around % of the stock) continued to be puzzling.##NewPara##Bank lending to companies had continued to grow steadily. Bond issuance had been low at the end of . But it usually was at that time of year, so underlying conditions were difficult to##NewPara##assess. The number of insolvencies had risen but from a relatively low level. The Committee concluded, as in previous months, that recent indicators did not suggest a material impairment of the supply of credit.##NewTopic##Demand and output##NewPara##Although there had been no change to the estimate of GDP growth in the third quarter of , there had been revisions both to the composition of GDP growth in Q, and to its rate of growth in earlier quarters. The level of output was now around .% lower than previously estimated, so pressure on capacity was likely to have been a little less than previously thought, all other things being equal. The three measures of GDP   income, expenditure and output   were diverging and that made it more difficult to judge the pace at which the economy was growing. Within the Q GDP figures, growth of final domestic demand had been revised down and the contribution from net trade and inventory building had been revised up. In particular, consumption growth had been revised down, and the pattern was of a more gradual slowdown over the past year than had previously been estimated. Consumer confidence remained weak.##NewPara##With the exception of the mortgage lending figures, the indicators suggested that housing market activity was slowing. Particulars delivered were now quite low compared with the past. The Halifax house price index had recorded a fall in prices for the second successive month. One view was that this provided further evidence of a loss of consumer confidence over the summer. However, the housing market was sensitive to interest rates, so a degree of slowing was to be expected following the tightening of monetary policy through  and the first half of . And members agreed that the relatively moderate rate of house price inflation over the past year was a welcome sign of greater stability than in past cycles.##NewPara##The contribution of stockbuilding to GDP growth had been revised up in the third quarter of , but there had been a downward revision to stock levels. In particular, stocks of finished manufactures had been revised down significantly. However, there seemed to be little news overall in the revisions to aggregate inventories, some of which reflected statistical changes in the National Accounts. Nonetheless, the balance of risks remained that the build up in inventories would be unwound by more than expected.##NewPara##The CBI Distributive Trades survey for December was less weak than the previous month s survey, but this news was probably offset by the weaker CIPS services survey. It was too soon to glean any reliable impression of the state of consumer spending over the Christmas/New Year period. Overall, the latest evidence from surveys and monthly indicators did not suggest that the latest best estimate for GDP growth in the fourth quarter was very different from that in the central projection in the November Inflation Report.##NewTopic##Labour market##NewPara##The labour market data continued to show rising employment and falling inactivity. But there were now further indications that unemployment was probably no longer falling. The recent data had shown a fall in long-term unemployment more than offset by a rise in short-term unemployment. The three CIPS surveys for manufacturing, services and construction were now all pointing to falling employment.##NewPara##The number of jobs recorded by the ONS Workforce survey had been revised up by , implying lower productivity and higher unit labour costs data. The Committee noted that its November Inflation Report projections had been based on the Labour Force Survey measure of employment, which was not affected by this revision.##NewPara##The Committee thought that the labour market remained tight, but that it seemed to have reached a turning point, and there were some signs of an easing of labour market pressures from the indicators of skill shortages and signs on pay settlements. The twelve-month employment- weighted average of pay settlements had been flat for many months and, depending on wage drift, this suggested a somewhat more benign path for earnings growth than had been expected around six months ago given the apparent tightening of the labour market. The Bank s regional Agents had reported some easing of upward pressure on pay growth. The current level of settlements was not especially comforting given the normal level of pay drift, but with the economy slowing members thought that there should be reduced pressure on pay from this source. And the reduction in interest rates over recent months would tend to lower RPI inflation relative to the target measure of RPIX in the short-term, which might influence settlements in coming months. Inflation expectations were important for wage setting, and had fallen in the latest surveys. These expectations might also be better anchored, following the monetary policy regime change, than had been the case in the past.##NewPara##According to the National Accounts estimate of wages and salaries per head, nominal growth had fallen to .% in the year to Q. Estimates of the real wage paid by producers   based on the GDP deflator at basic prices   showed that the rate of growth was still rising, and was consistent with past tightening of the labour market. However, the rate of increase of the real wage received by workers had been decreasing during . The wedge of over two percentage points between the two measures could be explained by past increases in taxes and changes in employers  contributions.##NewPara##The Committee noted that their assumption for earnings growth in  used in the November##NewPara##Inflation Report central projection was towards the top end of the range of outside forecasts made##NewPara##in November and December, and agreed that it would return to the issue in its discussion of the forecast for the February Inflation Report.##NewTopic##Other considerations bearing on the decision this month##NewPara##There were a number of reasons for expecting significant news over the next month. A large share of consumer spending happened around the Christmas period, and at the time of the January meeting the official estimate of retail sales in December was not available. But given the difficulty in seasonally adjusting the data at this time of the year, it would be some time before the full picture became clear. The first estimate of Q GDP would also become available by the time of the February meeting. In addition, it would be possible to observe the first settlements relating to January, which is an important month for pay agreements. Furthermore, it was still early to assess the impact of the introduction of the euro.##NewTopic##The immediate policy decision##NewPara##The Committee concluded that the prospects for global activity and prices were as bad as expected a month ago, and that the risks remained clearly on the downside. Some Committee members thought that these risks had increased somewhat in the past month, and that it seemed likely that the adjustment of the world economy to past demand shocks would prove more prolonged than some forecasts currently assumed.##NewPara##The main domestic news on the real side of the economy had been the small downward revision to the level of GDP and the change in the composition of GDP growth, especially the downward revision to consumption. On the other hand the recent news on retail sales was mixed, while the data on notes and coin, and world stock markets pointed to a stronger outlook for activity. And some of the surveys were perhaps not as weak as they had been a month ago. Nonetheless, recent indicators suggested that GDP growth in the fourth quarter of  would turn out broadly as expected at the time of the November Report. The labour market remained tight, but seemed to have reached a turning point.##NewPara##Given the picture for activity, nominal price and cost developments continued to be more benign than expected at the time of the November projections and, on the view of some members, than expected in December. The fall in the oil price in November had largely persisted through December. Producer input prices had continued to fall. Evidence from wage settlements and the Bank s regional Agents suggested an easing of upward pressures on the rate of increase of pay.##NewPara##On one view, given that there was not much news on the month, there was merit in waiting to gather another month s evidence and for the quarterly Inflation Report. The coming month would##NewPara##see some important data on Q GDP and settlements, and it was possible that the outcome of the Average Earnings Index review would be known. There were just enough signs of continuing demand growth in the recent data for the next month s data to be important to the policy decision. The quarterly forecasting round would provide an opportunity to reassess the level of interest rates. On balance, there was a case for pausing and making no change in interest rates this month. If in the event the evidence warranted it, a larger reduction in rates could be made next month.##NewPara##Members identified several possible reasons for an immediate reduction in rates. The adjustment in the world economy was likely to prove more prolonged than previously assumed, with external demand for UK goods and services through  correspondingly weaker. If so, there was less need for policy to put downward pressure on domestically generated inflation. In addition, the November Inflation Report central projection had also assumed robust real earnings growth and consumption. The revisions to the expenditure composition of domestic demand, together with the potential easing in the labour market and the apparent moderation of inflation expectations, suggested that the prospects for inflation looked weaker. A combination of these external and domestic factors suggested that a reduction in rates of .% (or possibly more in the view of some) was now warranted. If a reduction of .% to interest rates were made at the January meeting it was difficult to see that being inappropriate by the time of the February meeting. The probability of a reversal in rates seemed small, and reversals justified by economic news were anyway not problematic.##NewPara##Another view was that a cut of .% would have been preferable at the time of the December meeting on the basis of the news available then. With little, if any, news during the past month, a reduction of .% was still needed, and should be made now.##NewPara##Another view was that a reduction of .% would still leave rates above their neutral level, which was too high in the context of the current conjuncture. So the issue was how fast to reduce rates. There were three reasons for moving in steps rather than in one large reduction. First, a series of reductions might have a greater impact on consumer and business sentiment. Second, it might allow the Committee to learn more about the way the economy was responding to past shocks and policy changes. Third, it was important not to out-pace significantly the expectations of financial markets, as this could have unwanted consequences for asset prices and the exchange rate. Even though it was appropriate to move in a series of steps, the current level of rates was sufficiently above the rate required at this point in the cycle that a reduction of .% was needed now.##NewPara##The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank s repo rate be cut by .% to .%. Seven members of the Committee (the Governor,##NewPara##Mervyn King, David Clementi, Alan Budd, Willem Buiter, Charles Goodhart and John Vickers)##NewPara##voted for the proposition, and two (DeAnne Julius and Ian Plenderleith) voted against.##NewPara##DeAnne Julius preferred an immediate cut of .%, and Ian Plenderleith preferred to maintain the Bank s repo rate at .%.
