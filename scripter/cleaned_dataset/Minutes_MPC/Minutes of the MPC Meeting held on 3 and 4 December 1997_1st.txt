Levels versus growth rates##NewPara##The Committee discussed the importance of focusing not only on growth rates of economic variables but also on their levels. Above-trend growth rates of output and employment need not entail short-run inflationary pressures when there was plenty of spare capacity, as was typically the case when the economy was coming out of a prolonged recession. But as spare capacity was used up, underlying inflationary pressures would increase. Once the level of economic activity was above trend and/or the level of unemployment below the natural rate, increasing inflation would generally result.##NewPara##If the levels of output and employment then remained above trend, inflationary pressures would be exacerbated, requiring a more severe or prolonged slowdown to bring them back to trend levels.##NewPara##The Committee agreed with the importance of this general analysis. It was particularly relevant at the current stage of the cycle given the need to judge whether the economy was already above full capacity after the prolonged period of above trend growth rates. The costs of an over-expansionary monetary policy were likely to be greater than when the economy had been coming out of recession in the early-to-mid s.##NewPara##It was, however, very difficult to assess whether levels of activity were currently at, above or below the sustainable trend. Some collateral evidence was provided by surveys of capacity constraints,##NewPara##skill shortages etc, but it was inevitably inconclusive. There was, for example, considerable uncertainty about the effect of continuing labour market reform on the natural rate of unemployment. Thus while it seemed clear that the economy was close to capacity, it was difficult to be confident about the crucial question for policy of whether activity levels were already above trend.##NewPara##The same general principles could be applied to the monetary data, but the conclusions were not clear. Cumulatively strong money growth would in general be a cause for concern unless reasons for a change in the velocity of circulation could be identified, as for example had been the case with financial sector liberalisation in the s.##NewPara##On one view, it was also important to look at levels of money demand relative to long-run equilibrium. On another interpretation, assessing the monetary data along these lines was difficult. The monetary authorities operated by setting interest rates, so that monetary growth was endogenous. And, in contrast to goods and labour markets, financial markets probably cleared more or less continuously. On this view, there was no reason why the economy in aggregate or any sector should hold more money than desired; if so, then as a matter of principle there could not be a monetary overhang. Against this it could be argued that the costs of monitoring and adjusting money holdings might lead individuals or companies temporarily to hold more (or less) than their desired level of money balances, to which in principle they would eventually seek to return. But even if this view of  the process were correct, it left open the important issue of how quickly economic agents adjusted their money holdings and how they did so, whether by spending on goods or services, investment in financial assets, or repayment of bank loans.##NewPara##The Committee agreed that money growth needed to slow considerably if inflationary pressures were to abate.##NewTopic##Recent developments in monetary conditions##NewPara##Turning to the most recent monetary data, the Committee observed that the growth of notes and coin had picked up again after the dip earlier in the year. Taken together with continuing rapid, albeit slightly lower, growth in consumer credit, there was not much comfort from this source for the##NewPara##short-run outlook for consumption.##NewPara##However, aggregate M bank lending had continued to slow, and there were tentative signs of a slowdown in broad money growth, although the twelve-month rate of .% remained high.##NewPara##The slowdown in bank lending in October was attributable largely to a fall in reverse repo activity with OFIs, which was volatile from month to month. There had also been a progressive slowdown over the year in bank lending to non-financial companies. Even here, however, the picture was not completely clear, as up to Q ICC s foreign currency borrowing from UK banks and via capital markets had been increasing and the proceeds might have been swapped into sterling for domestic spending.##NewTopic##Consumption##NewPara##The Committee discussed the ONS s first estimate for consumption growth in Q which, at .%, was below the Bank s central projection in the November Inflation Report. This figure, however, might be revised. The ONS had only incomplete data and, as normal, had had to estimate a part of the services sector. They had assumed that service sector sales had been affected by the death of Diana, Princess of Wales to a similar extent as spending on goods.##NewPara##The Committee noted two developments that might suggest consumption growth was peaking. First, consumer confidence had fallen back, albeit from a relatively high level. Secondly, the Nationwide and Land Registry measures of house price increases had fallen slightly, and the Bank s regional Agents had also reported cooling in the housing market.##NewPara##The Committee agreed that consumption growth needed to moderate further for policy to be on course to achieve the inflation target.##NewTopic##External developments and the outlook for net trade##NewPara##The ONS s first estimate of the breakdown of the Q GDP statistics had contained some signs that net trade was beginning to slow, once erratic items were excluded. The Committee noted that since its previous meeting sterling had appreciated further. Analysis by Bank staff suggested that changed expectations for monetary policy in the UK or overseas were not the prime cause of the appreciation. A possible explanation of the recent appreciation against continental European currencies was a further  safe haven  effect brought about by continuing uncertainty about EMU, including about the level of interest rates on which the EMU  Ins  would converge in late /early . Sterling may also have been affected, alongside the dollar, by a  safe haven  effect in relation to East Asian currencies.##NewPara##The Committee discussed the implications of the East Asian developments. The world economic outlook was plainly different from six months ago. Improved prospects in the US and continental Europe might to some extent offset reduced demand from Asia, but it was too early to judge. There was anecdotal evidence that returns from the growth of markets in Asia and other developing regions had helped UK exporters to maintain trade with continental Europe by cutting margins following sterling s appreciation in . Demand from Asia had also been an important source of growth in exports for the G as a whole in recent years. It was possible that a slowdown in Asian markets would combine with sterling s continuing appreciation to bring about a fall in net exports in , as expected   or possibly more than expected   in the November Inflation Report.##NewPara##A second question was whether Asian problems threatened a more global financial crisis. Recent news had, on balance, offered encouragement on this score. Some countries outside Asia had implemented austerity packages as a protective measure; and the IMF appeared to have reached agreement with Korea on the conditions for support. Nevertheless the situation needed to be monitored carefully. The Committee s judgment remained that on the evidence so far the changing external environment did not of itself either require or prevent a change in UK monetary policy.##NewTopic##Labour market developments##NewPara##The Committee agreed that there was not much news on the labour market. Underlying earnings growth had ticked down slightly, but unemployment continued to fall, concerns about skill shortages persisted, and the Agents reported concerns around the country of emerging wage pressures. The reported settlement at Ford seemed high and would be a source of concern if, as in the s and early s, it set an economy-wide norm, but it had not done so in recent years.##NewTopic##Comparison of the Bank’s forecast with outside forecasts##NewPara##The Committee discussed the main reasons why the November Inflation Report central projection for inflation in the year to Q  was below virtually all outside forecasts even though its forecast for output growth was around their mean. These related to the effects of sterling s appreciation. The Bank s central projection assumed that some of the fall in import prices would be passed through to retail prices, unwinding some of the recent increase in retail margins; and that although delayed, there would still be a significant, and in  quite sharp, slowdown in net trade. The Committee agreed that qualitatively this was the most likely outcome but, as reflected in the November forecast, there was considerable uncertainty about its timing and magnitude. The slower the net trade effect was to come through, the greater the risks to the inflation target. It was also the case that recent inflation outturns had been above the Bank s recent forecasts.##NewTopic##The immediate policy decision##NewPara##The Committee identified a range of possible views on the outlook for inflation. One was that the level of activity was already above trend, perhaps materially so. In that case output growth would need to slow sharply in order to avoid a marked increase in inflation. If instead growth slowed gradually so that activity levels remained above trend, it would prove necessary to tighten policy while output growth was falling. On such a view, policy might need to be tightened again quite soon if there were not clear evidence in the early part of the New Year that the economy was slowing sharply.##NewPara##Another possibility was that the economy was close to but not clearly above capacity, although still growing above trend. The economy was therefore delicately poised. Retail price##NewPara##inflation was higher than had been expected in the summer, remained stubbornly high, and increased wage pressures were widely expected. On the other hand, domestic demand growth should slow given the tightening of monetary and fiscal policy. And the effects of sterling s appreciation on inflation was still expected to come through, via a slowdown in net trade and greater pass-through into retail prices.##NewPara##A further possible view was to take encouragement for the inflation outlook from the most recent data. There were signs that output would peak in Q, as the Bank had forecast, and that the economy would slow in the first half of . Developments in Asia could mean that the slowdown in net trade would be more pronounced than forecast in the November Inflation Report. If uncertainty over EMU and other external developments continued, sterling might not depreciate in line with uncovered interest parity as had been assumed in the November forecast, which could improve the inflation outlook. And while the pace of slowdown needed to avert a pick up in inflation depended on whether there was any slack in the economy, some encouragement on this score might be taken from the persistence of muted producer input and output prices.##NewPara##The Committee agreed that there was uncertainty about where the economy was in relation to capacity and that this made the policy judgment very difficult. There had been relatively little news in the last month s data that helped to resolve this question, given that the Committee had already been expecting a strong Q. That being so, there was a case for waiting to see further developments. It was also possible that the exchange rate would prove especially sensitive to an interest rate move at a time of unusual uncertainty in global financial markets.##NewPara##The Committee then voted unanimously in favour of leaving the Bank s repo rate unchanged.
