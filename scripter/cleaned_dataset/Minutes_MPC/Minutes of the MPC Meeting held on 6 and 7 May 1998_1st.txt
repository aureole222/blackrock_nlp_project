Monetary developments##NewPara##The Committee noted the continuing signs of slowing monetary growth. The twelve month growth rate of M had fallen below % in March, having been above % during the middle of ; and the  and  month annualised growth rates were in a -% range. Slower growth in the narrower aggregates - M, retail M, Divisia - and in personal sector M supported this picture and suggested that, in addition to a worsening external position, past increases in official interest rates were having an effect, both indirectly via slower demand growth and directly via the greater opportunity cost of holding zero or low interest-bearing deposit accounts rather than other financial assets.##NewPara##However, after slowing during , there had recently been little change in aggregate credit growth. Annual growth in total credit to households had been steady at around % for over a year. While it was possible that mortgage lending had edged down, unsecured credit had if anything accelerated in recent months. Bank and building society lending to industrial and commercial companies (ICCs) had risen sharply in the first quarter. Arguably this was consistent with the past pattern of ICCs increasing borrowing following a monetary tightening. It could also be consistent with businesses in externally exposed sectors of the economy needing to make greater use of credit lines to finance working capital. But it was too early to judge whether this was the explanation or whether, alternatively, steady credit growth was a sign of continuing strength in those parts of the economy which were relatively sheltered from the effects of sterling s appreciation and still growing at close to or above trend rates.##NewPara##Overall, the Committee felt that the money numbers were broadly consistent with some slowing of demand and activity but that this was less evident in the recent credit data.##NewTopic##GDP growth##NewPara##The Committee noted that the Office of National Statistics  (ONS s) first estimate of GDP growth in Q - .%, .% excluding oil and gas - was lower than expected. The level of GDP was, on these estimates, about  % below the central projection in the February Inflation Report.##NewPara##Annual growth of total GDP had peaked in Q  at .%, with a fall since then to .% by Q ; quarterly growth rates had peaked in Q . Backward-looking survey data were, however, stronger than the ONS figures. When surveys had been stronger than official estimates in the past, the tendency had been for the official data to be revised up to close part of the gap. If this pattern were repeated, the official activity data for  and the first part of  could be revised up. It seemed likely, however, that any such revisions would leave intact the growth profile, with the turning point in mid-.##NewPara##The sectoral picture varied. Growth in the energy supply industries had been depressed by the unusually mild winter, so that underlying activity growth might not have weakened as much as suggested by the headline numbers.##NewPara##Manufacturing was clearly slowing, and quite possibly facing recession, due to the impact of sterling s appreciation on external demand and on overseas competition in home markets. By contrast, construction seemed recently to have been buoyant, particularly on the basis of survey data and anecdotal reports from the Bank s regional Agents and other industry contacts. It was, moreover, widely expected to remain so through , supported by Millennium-related projects.##NewPara##Recent developments and prospects in the services sector were agreed to be less clear. On the one hand, the ONS first estimate of Q growth was .%, down from .% in Q ; and the service sector trade surplus had fallen. On the other hand, the first estimate was not based on all the hard data that would eventually become available; and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and##NewPara##Supply (CIPS) services survey suggested an increase in the growth rate in Q compared with Q,##NewPara##although not all services were covered by CIPS. On balance it was likely that the services sector was slowing, but that its growth rate remained above trend.##NewTopic##Domestic demand##NewPara##Domestic demand had grown in a   -% range for most of last year and the available data on net trade and GDP implied little if any slowdown in Q. Domestic demand was likely to have been driven by consumption, consistent with Q growth of .% in retail sales, which was modestly slower than through  but nevertheless left the annual rate at %. The Bank s February forecast had not, however, expected a material slowdown in consumption growth during Q.##NewPara##Looking ahead, there were opposing forces. While house price inflation was relatively modest compared with past cyclical upturns, the cumulative rise in equity prices had taken the ratio of financial wealth-to-income to its highest ever level. This was likely to support continuing robust consumption growth. But consumption demand should gradually be moderated by the past tightening of monetary and fiscal policy; and annual growth rates should fall as the effects of the initial concentration of spending out of building society windfalls in  unwound. The CBI distributive Trades Survey already suggested slowing retail sales growth, taking account of the month-to-month fluctuations reflecting the timing of Easter.##NewTopic##Net trade##NewPara##It was clear that net exports had been weakening quite sharply, with an estimated negative contribution to Q GDP growth of around  %. Data for  had been progressively revised, bringing them more into line with what surveys had been saying at the time and with the Bank s earlier expectations.##NewPara##Puzzles remained, however, about both composition and causes. The relative resilience of net exports to EU countries was difficult to understand given that sterling s appreciation had been so much greater against those currencies. The Bank s Agents suggested that this might reflect UK##NewPara##exporters attaching strategic importance to retaining their position in European markets, even when##NewPara##profitability was low. There had been a striking fall in exports to crisis-affected Asian countries since the autumn, but this was only a modest part of total overseas trade.##NewPara##A particularly important question, which the Committee had discussed an earlier occasions, was whether net exports were being depressed by weakening external demand or by continuing strong domestic demand drawing in imports, which could be a sign of latent inflationary pressures. The latest surveys and data offered some comfort that it was, at least in part, the former. That suggested that the effects of sterling s appreciation were slower to come through than originally expected rather than the cumulative effect being materially smaller, although some members thought that this could still not be ruled out.##NewPara##The Committee discussed the implications of the sharp turnaround it expected in the current account, almost % of GDP from mid- to end-. Given the forecast that the Government s finances would be close to balance, the private sector would be expected to accumulate external debt. It started with a stronger balance sheet and thus was in a better position to do so than in some previous cycles. However there might also be a larger depreciation of sterling than in the May Inflation Report central projection, which assumed that sterling would fall gradually in line with implied interest rate differentials. A greater depreciation was, as in February, included in the forecast as a risk.##NewTopic##The labour market##NewPara##LFS unemployment had fallen to .% in February from .% in January. This and most other data suggested that labour market conditions were still getting tighter. One piece of contrary evidence was a recorded fall in hours worked in December-February compared with the previous three months, but this was difficult to interpret because there had been a similar fall last year which had been followed by an increase. It was, however, clear that the pace of tightening had slowed quite markedly. Surveys suggested that skill shortages were more widespread than the long-run average, but less so than during the late s  upturn.##NewPara##The Committee discussed how best to interpret the fall in long-term unemployment. One possibility was that current and earlier structural reforms were increasing the employability of the long-run employed, which would be helping to relieve labour market pressures. It might also be##NewPara##signalling a very tight market, with short-term employment having fallen as far as it could, forcing firms to recruit from the long-term unemployed. Another possibility was that a higher than usual proportion of the short-run unemployed might be finding jobs in conditions of continuing strong demand and activity growth, rather than becoming long-term unemployed. It was too early to tell which of these was the main explanation.##NewPara##Headline average earnings growth had remained at .% in February. Settlements, including the latest data covering the beginning of April, did not show signs of picking up further and had been steady since the autumn. These outturns were better than feared by some a quarter ago and much better than would have been expected given the fall in unemployment and rise in employment over the past year.##NewPara##It was possible that this meant the trade-off between unemployment and earnings growth had improved, either via continuing labour market reforms bringing down the natural rate of unemployment, or via a fall in inflation expectations reducing nominal earnings growth, or a combination of the two. It was also possible, moreover, that the forecast slowdown in output and aggregate demand growth in  and  would moderate wage claims and earnings growth. On a benign view, therefore, it was possible that the period of greatest risk had already passed without earnings growth rising above the rate consistent with the inflation target and trend productivity growth.##NewPara##The Committee agreed, however, that it would not be prudent to conclude this yet. First, there was a sharp contrast between private and public sector earnings growth. The former had risen at an annual rate of over % in the latest period, whereas public sector earnings were reported as having grown at   %. There were some doubts about whether the public sector figures were accurate as it was not clear in which parts of the public sector earnings growth had been below   %. The ratio of public-to-private sector earnings had for some years been trending downwards and becoming less volatile. This might be consistent with labour market reforms, contracting out and retirement from the public sector of older, higher paid workers, but it was not clear how much further this process had to go or whether the pattern of the past few years was merely cyclical. Some members of the Committee thought it more likely than not that the differential would close somewhat, and that this would come about mostly via a rise in public sector earnings growth. In that case, the % plus growth of private sector earnings was a better indicator of labour market tightness than the headline##NewPara##Secondly, it was possible that the lags from a tightening labour market to rising earnings growth were longer than had been expected. This would be plausible because the moderating effect of sterling s appreciation on retail price rises had improved workers  real wages (assessed in terms of their purchasing power over consumption goods). In that case, wage claims might have been lower than otherwise. If this was part of the explanation, the effect was unlikely to be sustainable. If, as expected, sterling stopped appreciating, and a fortiori if it fell back, wage claims might increase.##NewTopic##Commodity prices##NewPara##The Committee noted that the short-run effects on inflation from commodity price changes remained very benign. Sterling oil prices had risen slightly over the latest month but remained nearly % lower than a year earlier. The Bank s sterling commodity index was % down over the same period including oil, and .% excluding oil. Manufacturing output prices (excluding excise duties) were flat since February and only .% higher than a year ago.##NewPara##Together with the effect of sterling s appreciation, these developments had made a material contribution to lower inflation over the past twelve months, offsetting higher domestically generated inflation. It could not be assumed that this would continue into the period ahead, although external price developments were expected to remain benign, partly because of the sharp fall in Asian demand for commodities and manufactured goods. However, this would partly be offset in the period ahead by the expected depreciation of sterling.##NewTopic##Government finances##NewPara##The Committee noted that the / PSBR, ignoring the effect of windfall taxes and associated spending, was     bn, around     bn less than forecast in the March Budget.##NewPara##It remained unclear, however, to what extent this reflected an increase in the tax base through higher than so far measured activity, and to what extent it was caused by a higher tax yield and so an effective fiscal tightening.##NewTopic##The May inflation forecast##NewPara##The Committee reviewed and agreed the inflation forecast to be published in the Inflation Report on Wednesday  May.##NewPara##The main changes to the central projection since the February forecast were fourfold. First, the level of GDP was about half a percentage point lower throughout the forecast period. This reflected a lower starting point due to the -.% revision to the estimated Q  level and to lower than expected estimated growth in Q; and weaker net trade and investment growth than assumed in February. This meant that forecast pressures on capacity, and so on inflation, were less than expected in February.##NewPara##Secondly, inflation expectations, which fed into nominal earnings growth, were forecast to be slightly lower than in February. This was in line with the recent evidence that most measures of inflation expectations had been edging down.##NewPara##Third, February s forecast had used the broad non-employment rate as the measure of labour market tightness in the central projection, but added an upwards skew to earnings growth by using the LFS measure of unemployment in assessing the risks. The Committee decided that the LFS measure should be used in the central projection rather than in the skew. The May central projection therefore assumed a tighter labour market at the starting point and a further rise in earnings growth. The change added to inflationary pressure in the central projection, but reduced the upward skew.##NewPara##Finally, the May forecast was based on a higher starting point for the sterling exchange rate than in February. This reflected the Committee s practice of using the  day average of the Sterling ERI as the starting point; it had risen from  to . since February.##NewPara##The Committee decided not to make any assumptions about the proposed minimum wage. It needed to know the precise terms and then consider the minimum wage alongside the Government s other labour market reforms before it could reach an assessment of the implications for inflation and identify any consequent implications for policy. There was agreement, however, that the minimum wage by itself was likely to put upward pressure on inflation.##NewPara##The Committee noted that first three changes to the assumptions identified above were broadly offsetting at the  year horizon, so that the change in the exchange rate starting point was crucial in accounting for the slight fall in the central projection since February. Sterling had, though, been falling in recent days, principally against other EU currencies, and was now close to the level used in the February forecast. This seemed to reflect the market s reaction to EU decisions about the ECB President and Executive Board. There was a range of views about whether these latest developments would mark a turning point for sterling, triggered by reduced uncertainty about EMU. The Committee agreed that the recent movements in the exchange rate underlined its earlier view, discussed at previous meetings, that policy conclusions could not be read off the forecast in a mechanical way.##NewPara##The Committee discussed the risks to the forecast. In the short run, the net risks to inflation were on the downside, mainly through the possibility of weaker world growth than assumed, and the risk of a significant fall in equity prices, reducing wealth and so consumption growth. Towards the end of the forecast horizon, the net risks to inflation were thought to be on the upside, largely because of the possibility of sterling depreciating more quickly than implied by interest rate differentials. The Committee agreed that the inflation outturn would be affected not only by whether asset prices did depart from the paths assumed in the central projection, but also by whether they did so gradually or suddenly and, if suddenly, whether early or late in forecast period. The Committee agreed that policy should not respond to the risk of sharp asset price movements. They would need to assess the implications for the inflation outlook if and when any such changes occurred.##NewTopic##The immediate policy decision##NewPara##There was broad agreement that the news since February - the lower than expected level of current output, the clear evidence of a decline in net trade, still robust domestic demand growth, the##NewPara##stability of earnings growth, the slight fall in inflation expectations, signs of slowing broad money growth - were reflected in the May forecast.##NewPara##On one view, the inflation outlook over the forecast period - out to around two years - had improved since February and, on the May forecast, there was no longer a pressing case for an immediate rise in interest rates. The outlook was nevertheless uncomfortable. On this view, with the benefit of some hindsight, monetary policy should have been tighter during  and into  (although, on another view, fiscal policy should perhaps have been set more directly to reduce consumption growth). As a consequence domestically generated inflation remained high, with inflation projected to be in line, or a little below, the target over the forecast period only by virtue of the beneficial effects of sterling s appreciation and falling world commodity prices. Given the strength of domestic demand it was likely that a further slowdown in the internationally exposed sectors was now needed to achieve the inflation target on the exchange rate profile assumed in the central projection; and economy-wide unemployment would probably have to rise to hit the target on a sustainable basis. Monetary policy was in effect boxed in and would not be able to respond to any future positive shocks to inflation by accommodating their first-round effects.##NewPara##On this first view, while interest rates did not need to increase immediately, it was still more likely than not that they would have to go up in due course (although the probability of this had fallen somewhat). This was for four reasons. First, on the assumptions in the central projection, inflation was set to rise towards and beyond the two-year horizon as domestic demand was not projected to moderate sufficiently to offset the wearing off of the beneficial but temporary external influences. Second, the risks to inflation were clearly on the upside at the end of the two-year horizon, largely because sterling might fall more rapidly than assumed on the central projection. Third, in the run up to the Committee s meeting, sterling had fallen materially below the starting point assumed in the forecast. Fourth, the forecast did not take into account the planned minimum wage; while it would be a mistake for policy to do so before its terms were clear, the implication of the minimum wage was that future policy would need to be tighter than otherwise. For those reasons, it was important that a no-change decision should not lead the market to conclude that official rates had peaked. The Overview section of the Inflation Report should be drafted with this in mind.##NewPara##On a second view there had not been much news over the past month materially to change the implications for policy. Net trade had clearly been weakening, and consumption in the first quarter##NewPara##had been broadly in line with earlier expectations, with a few signs - for example in the money numbers - that it may moderate, as it certainly needed to. The labour market remained delicately poised; the last few months  data had offered some encouragement but pressures clearly remained and it was therefore right that the effects on prospective inflation of using the LFS measure had been moved to the central projection. While the external influences might have taken current and prospective inflation below the inflation target had overall policy been tighter in -, the Committee should not conclude that it should raise interest rates now to compensate. Its job was to set policy to achieve the   % target; on the latest forecast, it was broadly on track to do so over the coming  years. Looking further ahead, the key to the outlook for inflation and policy would be the path of domestic demand. If it did not slow by more than was currently expected a further policy tightening might be needed at some point, but it was not necessary to take a firm view on that now.##NewPara##The outlook over the forecast horizon was sufficiently benign to give the Committee time to collect more information about developments without endangering the inflation target over the period that current policy settings could materially affect. It would in particular be a mistake to anticipate possible but highly uncertain future moves in asset markets. On this view also, while not raising rates this month, it was important that the Committee should not signal that rates had peaked.##NewPara##A third view emphasised a need for policy to react now to the possible sources of inflationary pressure towards and through the end of the two-year forecast horizon. Four considerations were emphasised. First, it was possible that equity prices would rise faster than assumed in the central projection, putting upward pressure on consumption and investment. Second, sterling s recent fall meant both that its starting point was lower than assumed in the central projection and also that its depreciation might be steeper as, with uncertainty about EMU reducing, it was more likely that a turning point for sterling had been reached. Third, the minimum wage was expected to put upward pressure on inflation and there was not enough leeway in the outlook for there to be no policy response at all until its terms were known. Fourth, inflation was set to be rising into the third year even on the central projection s assumptions. On these arguments the safer stance was for policy to be tightened by a further bp immediately.##NewPara##A fourth view stressed the gathering evidence that the economy, including parts of the services sector , was now clearly slowing. On the new central projection, inflation was forecast to be below the target for virtually all of the forecast period. This was consistent with a soft landing - the desired rebalancing of external and domestic demand in the economy as it returned to trend growth. Yet with##NewPara##official interest rates at their current level, the yield curve remained steeply inverted and the real short- term interest rate was probably over %. Policy was therefore tighter than was necessary at this stage of the cycle. While there were upside risks to inflation, there were also downside risks both to output and to inflation, including the possibility that inflation expectations could moderate further as the economy slowed and the headline rate came down in the summer, which could help to contain wage pressures. The upside implications of the minimum wage would need to be assessed with the downside effects of the Government s New Deal. Until that was done it was hard to justify a presumption either way. On these arguments, there was a case for reducing rates now, by bp, to begin the process of moving policy back to a more neutral stance, consistent with meeting the inflation target.##NewPara##The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank s repo rate be left unchanged this month. Six members of the Committee (the Governor, David Clementi, Alan Budd, Charles Goodhart, Mervyn King and Ian Plenderleith) voted for the proposition, and two (Willem Buiter and DeAnne Julius) voted against. Willem Buiter preferred an immediate rise in interest rates and DeAnne Julius an immediate cut.
