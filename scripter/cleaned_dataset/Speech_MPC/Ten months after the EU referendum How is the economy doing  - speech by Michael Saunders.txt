I would like to thank Thomas Belsham, Stuart Berry, Ben Broadbent, Pavandeep Dhami, Will Dison, Kristin Forbes, Dena Jacobs, Joanna Konings, Tamara Li, Clare Macallan, Gareth Ramsay, ###newline### Chris Redl, Matthew Trott, Alex Tuckett, Carleton Webb, and Garry Young for their help in preparing this speech. The views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the other members of the Monetary Policy Committee ###newline### I ll start with the first of those points: the economy s recent   and welcome   resilience. In the August  IR, just after the Brexit vote, the MPC forecast that the economy would slow markedly, with quarterly growth close to zero in H  and early . The BoE was not alone in expecting weaker growth: the IMF and OECD made similar forecasts, and in general the consensus was slightly gloomier than the BoE (see ###newline### figure ). In practice, growth has remained solid. Indeed, on the current vintage of the ONS data, quarterly GDP growth in H  was slightly stronger than H. ###newline### Compared to the BoE s forecasts from last August, the economy s outperformance in H  was spread widely across consumer spending, housing and business investment. Exports and imports both did better than expected, but net trade overall was less supportive than forecast last August (see figure ). In terms of contributions to QoQ GDP growth in H , the upside in business and housing investment combined was worth slightly more than the upside in consumer spending. Real wages turned out slightly softer than expected, with slightly higher inflation and lower pay growth than forecast. Household savings have fallen more than expected. ###newline### Even with weakness in retail sales volumes, most recent evidence suggests that the economy continued to grow in Q of this year. For example, most business surveys are around longrun averages, job growth has picked up, and NIESR estimate Q growth at .% QoQ. The latest survey from the Federation of Small Businesses is broadly consistent with this picture (see figure ). ###newline### First, the judgment that the possible longrun effects of Brexit would produce a modest adverse effect on actual and potential growth nearterm. Analysis by the IMF and OECD suggests that Brexit will reduce UK potential growth slightly over time, the next  years or so. Possible factors at work include reduced trade openness, reduced inward investment, reduced competition in some sectors, lower net inward migration, and the need to reallocate resources between different sectors. Of course, the long-run effects of EU exit are highly uncertain, and perceptions may well change markedly as the details become clearer. ###newline### The BoE s forecast assumed these longrun Brexit effects would come in linearly, hence having some effect even in the first year or two, before Brexit actually occurs. ###newline### Second, and more importantly, the BoE interpreted the sharp dive in business surveys just after the referendum as indicating that heightened uncertainty over the UK s future trading arrangements would weigh heavily on nearterm growth, notably consumer spending, business investment, housing and commercial property. This appeared consistent with evidence that uncertainty often causes businesses and households to defer major spending decisions. ###newline### No single measure can always reflect all aspects of uncertainty. The BoE s approach is to combine various indicators, including financial market data, surveys of households and businesses, and media citations of uncertainty. There was a sharp spike in this and other uncertainty gauges just after the Brexit vote. This was accompanied by a marked deterioration in business surveys, commercial and residential real estate markets, and other signs (eg a preference for hiring temporary, rather than permanent, staff) that seemed to reflect heightened business caution (see figure ). The BoE s mid-August forecast put a lot of weight on that sudden deterioration, although the forecast was actually less pessimistic than the surveys implied. ###newline### The third factor was the sharp drop in sterling, which is down by -% since late-, with about two thirds of that depreciation occurring after the referendum. The BoE judged that this depreciation would lift inflation above target in -, eroding consumers  real incomes and spending. But, reflecting ###newline### Brexit-related factors (including long run issues discussed above), the forecast assumed the lift to export volumes from sterling s depreciation would be less than usual. ###newline### Of course, forecasts are fallible. They will always be wrong in some respect. This does not mean that forecasts are useless. It typically takes one to three years for the full effects of monetary policy actions on growth and inflation to come through. Forecasts help the central bank to distinguish between transitory developments in the economy   which usually do not warrant a monetary policy response   and more important underlying trends. It is better to include forecasts in the policy process   accepting that the forecasts are imperfect   rather than to only consider the economy's recent trends. Moreover, it is useful for central banks to publish their forecasts to achieve public accountability for their actions, and to explain why monetary policy has been set a certain way to meet the inflation target. Such forecasts also should make it easier for observers with different views about the outlook to gauge how policy might evolve if they rather than the central bank turn out to be right. ###newline### In that spirit, I would like to highlight several factors that probably help explain the economy s recent outperformance. ###newline### First, Brexit-related uncertainty probably mattered less than expected. The post-referendum spike in the BoE s uncertainty index proved short-lived and this measure now roughly matches its long-run norm. This has been reflected in a commensurate rebound in business confidence and hiring attitudes, with a relatively stable housing market. Moreover, the measurement of uncertainty is itself uncertain. ###newline### Second, UK monetary conditions loosened significantly in response to the Brexit vote. The MPC cut Bank Rate and resumed asset purchases, the Term Funding Scheme helped ensure that the rate cut was fully passed through, while the FPC s reduction in the counter-cyclical capital buffer cut risks that the referendum outcome led to tighter credit conditions. ###newline### All this, plus the lift to export profitability from sterling s sharp depreciation, probably gave some boost to demand and confidence in recent quarters. Of course, forecasts made at the time largely included these factors, but their combined effect may have been greater than expected. The boost from these looser financial conditions is not yet over. ###newline### Third, global activity has been stronger, with better trends in world trade, business surveys and consumer surveys. This has given some lift to UK export prospects   but, perhaps more importantly, probably also boosted asset prices and UK growth expectations. This is nothing to do with the Brexit vote, it just happened to occur at around the same time. ###newline### mortgage rate with % LTV has fallen by over bp since last May. It is hard to disentangle effects of uncertainty from changes in credit conditions, because they often move closely together. But the UK s  experience supports the idea that uncertainty matters much less for growth if credit conditions do not worsen. ###newline### And fifth, it is also possible that, unconnected to the Brexit vote, the UK expansion has developed greater momentum and resilience, reflecting low unemployment, several years of solid real income growth, and a reduced emphasis on balance sheet repair following the - recession. Aggregate corporate liquidity is relatively high, the ratio of household wealth to income is at a record high, and private sector money growth has been reasonably firm since late- (see figures  and ). Once the post-Brexit uncertainty spike faded, these positive underlying drivers have helped sustain demand in recent quarters. ###newline### These factors, some of which are mutually reinforcing, probably help to explain why demand has held up better than expected. Many of these factors are likely to carry forward, supported also by the reduced pace of UK fiscal tightening announced in the Autumn Statement and recent Budget. As a result, the BoE has several times raised its near-term growth forecasts, and our central forecast for  growth (published in the February IR) is above the external consensus. As it became clear that the economy was doing better than expected, the MPC moved from an easing bias last August to a neutral position in late . Our latest forecast, based on market rates, assumes a gently rising path of interest rates. ###newline### For the sake of argument, let s assume for now that the work by the IMF and OECD is valid, and that Brexit will lead to a slightly worse outlook for trade openness, investment, and productivity growth over time. Over the long run, this is unlikely to affect either way the MPC's ability to keep inflation close to the % target, although it would affect the rate of economic growth consistent with that inflation path. ###newline### The near-term adjustment to Brexit may well differ from those long run trends in several respects. ###newline### This is partly because the full effect of supply-side changes usually takes time to come through, especially for productivity growth. It is also because the Brexit vote triggered a large depreciation of sterling, and this depreciation will have powerful effects on the economy in the next year or two. It is also because the UK economy is evolving in ways that have nothing to do with Brexit. Overall, I suspect that the next year or two will see steady growth, above-target inflation, stronger exports, and a pickup in business investment. And there are no signs so far that productivity trends are weakening. ###newline### CPI inflation has already risen from around zero in early  to .% in February/March this year, the highest since late-. And the pace of price hikes has quickened notably in recent months. The ###newline### -month/-month seasonally adjusted annualized rate is running at about % for the headline CPI and ###newline###  - % for core inflation. Both are the highest for over  years. These short-term measures are volatile, and our target is for the -month change in the CPI. But these short-term growth rates help illustrate the extent to which price hikes already are coming through, and beginning to squeeze consumers  real incomes. ###newline### Part of this rise in YoY inflation rates reflects the pass-through to prices of tradable goods and services from sterling s depreciation, including that before the referendum. But there are other factors, including global trends in oil and commodity prices. Indeed, YoY CPI inflation has risen by a similar amount in the OECD as a whole, and only slightly less in the Euro Area (see figure ). ###newline### In my view, there are risks that the near-term boost to inflation from sterling s depreciation will be somewhat steeper than the February IR base case, even with modest wage growth. In particular, a range of indicators point to sizeable cost pressures in sectors focused on tradable items, a message backed up by the latest FSB survey. These surveys mostly measure the breadth, rather than the pace, of price increases. But in the past, they have been a useful guide to inflation trends for CPI items with a relatively high import content, and point to considerable further upside in CPI prices in the next few quarters (see figure ). ###newline### Either way, I want to stress that this prospective near-term inflation pickup does not imply that Brexit Britain will face persistently high inflation. Nor does it signal that the MPC has gone soft on our low inflation remit. ###newline### Over time, the appropriate monetary policy can and will ensure that inflation returns to the % target, consistent with our remit. ###newline### Exports did not play much role in the economy s resilience in the last few quarters. However, most recent business surveys (including the FSB survey) show buoyant readings for export orders, confidence and deliveries (see figure ). These surveys suggest that in aggregate, UK exports are now likely to benefit more or less as usual from sterling's depreciation rather than the more muted response implied by consensus and BoE forecasts. ###newline### This produces something of a paradox: the referendum triggered a substantial sterling depreciation, probably reflecting the view that Brexit will, over time, hinder UK exports in some way. But, for now, the UK remains a full EU member with corresponding trade access. There is the possibility of an implementation phase that might keep the UK s trade arrangements fairly close to their current status for a period beyond the expiry of the normal -year Article  deadline. The possibility of less-favourable trading arrangements post-Brexit may still be too uncertain and distant to constrain exports in many sectors. ###newline### Hence, as my colleague Ben Broadbent noted, UK exporters are currently in something of a  sweet spot . In the near-term, the boost from sterling s depreciation may well outweigh any adverse Brexit effects and generate quite strong export growth, especially given signs of better external growth. CBI surveys suggest that a record share of manufacturing firms report improved competitiveness versus EU and non-EU markets in recent quarters (see figure ). ###newline### Indeed, even though the improvement in export orders has yet to be fully reflected in export volumes, increases in export prices are already lifting the relative profitability of export-focused sectors. For example, ONS data show a sharp rise in H  in the growth of nominal value added in sectors for which exports play a major role (see figure ), with a marked disparity between domestic-focused and export-focused sectors. ###newline### Not all export-related sectors are benefiting equally. In particular, optimism over export prospects has risen more sharply in sectors which usually have relatively short order books. On balance, in sectors with very long order books (eg aerospace) -- and whose order books are perhaps more likely to extend into post-Brexit conditions   optimism over export prospects has fallen slightly (see figure ). Some sectors may be constrained by limited spare capacity. Moreover, service sector exporters are generally less ###newline### currency-sensitive than manufacturing, and, correspondingly, report less recent improvement in external competitiveness and export prospects. Nevertheless, there are signs of a sizeable boost from the low pound in some service sectors, especially those focused on tourism in the UK. ###newline### If we have been too early in assuming that Brexit will reduce the economy s openness, imports may also prove to be stronger. Even so, I suspect that exports and net trade will add a bit more to growth this year, and perhaps also , than generally expected. Of course, this does not prove or disprove the notion (which seems to be implicit in sterling s depreciation) that Brexit might constrain UK exports longer term. ###newline### Regarding business investment   again, in contrast to worries of Brexit s long-run effects   surveys suggest that firms  investment intentions have improved recently and are slightly above average overall, especially in manufacturing (see figure ). Reflecting the boost from sterling s depreciation, the share of manufacturing firms citing capacity expansion as a key reason to invest is the highest since , with particularly high readings among larger firms (more than  employees). ###newline### Investment may be supported also by the strength of corporate profits. The ratio of private non-oil corporate profits to GDP in Q last year was the highest since  (see figure ). Taking annual data, the return on capital for nonoil non-financial companies in  was the highest since . Overall corporate liquidity is strong, and both the cost and availability of credit are favourable. Moreover,the BoE agents report that for some firms, the need to increase efficiency in the face of increases in energy, labour and materials costs is an additional spur to nearterm investment. ###newline### To be sure, Brexit uncertainties may limit the extent to which current favourable trading conditions lead to strong investment growth and increased export capacity. But even so, for now, the indications from business surveys seem to me to be less weak than implied by the consensus. ###newline### Productivity trends are more mixed. The BoE s view has been that any adverse effects of Brexit on productivity will be very gradual. In practice, with faster output growth but slower job growth, productivity (output per hour) picked up to .% YoY in Q , roughly half-way between the recent pace (- average of .% YoY) and the pre-crisis average (- average was .% YoY). ###newline### It is possible that, with the economy probably near full employment and uncertainties over the future availability of foreign workers, firms may now be more likely to increase investment in training and ###newline### labour-saving technology, or to undertake difficult decisions to re-engineer internal processes, in ways that deliver more lasting productivity gains. Conversely, in recent years, the ample availability of ###newline### labour -- including foreign workers   may have encouraged some firms to adopt labour-intensive production methods, and fuelled growth in labour-intensive sectors. ###newline### But it is also possible that the productivity pickup in H  was partly temporary, with Brexit uncertainties leading firms to defer hiring despite solid activity growth. Hence, there may now be a catch-up in labour ###newline### demand. Indeed, the latest ONS figures show a sharp rise in hours worked in early  (see figure ). The BoE agents report a slight pickup in firms  hiring intentions (see figure ), while the FSB survey points to quite a marked rise in hiring plans. So it currently appears that the late- productivity pickup is not being sustained. ###newline### I stress that these recent and prospective near-term trends in prices, productivity, exports and investment probably tell us very little either way over the long-run effects of Brexit over the next - years. ###newline### My hunch is that in - we will see higher near-term inflation, plus a greater rotation of growth away from consumer spending and towards investment and net trade, than the February IR base case. The upturns in exports and investment may keep the economy growing at around % YoY across - combined even as consumer spending slows. To me, growth seems more likely to exceed the external consensus (which is for around  % in - combined) that to undershoot. ###newline### The continued modest pace of pay growth suggests that the output gap is not fully closed.  Nevertheless, with the jobless rate down to .%, matching the lows of the last  years, slack is probably quite limited. Moreover, recent months have seen quite a sharp drop in the numbers of under-employed part-time workers and in the numbers of people who would like to work but are loosely attached to the workforce. As a result, a U-style under-employment rate - which adds these groups to the official jobless rate   has fallen from .% four months ago to .% now, and is only slightly above the - average (.%). ###newline### Unless the recent productivity pick up of H  is maintained   for which (as noted) evidence currently is slim   economic growth of around % implies that unemployment and under-employment are unlikely to rise in coming quarters and may well fall further. ###newline### Of course, there are many uncertainties. For example, consumers might retrench more than expected in response to the currency-driven erosion of their real incomes. Exports might fail to live up to hopes evident in business surveys. The process of Brexit might be bumpy, creating new waves of uncertainties. But there are also upside risks to growth. For example, consumers might view the real wage squeeze as temporary and, amidst ample credit availability, save less and maintain spending more than expected. Moreover, the factors behind the economy's recent outperformance, including better global growth, may continue to propel the economy more than expected going forward. ###newline### The neutral interest rate is probably significantly lower than in the period before , but even so, I judge that the current policy stance is clearly accommodative. The lower neutral rate implies that, if the MPC were to lift rates at some stage, the tightening path probably would be limited and gradual. Moreover   and, again, while not prejudging what I or the MPC might decide on monetary policy   a modest rise in rates would still imply that considerable stimulus remains in place, helping to support output and jobs. ###newline### At the MPC s most recent meeting, in March, I voted for unchanged policy, especially on the grounds that it would be useful to see a bit more economic data for early . I am not going to announce today how I will vote at the May meeting. There is plenty of data still to receive, and insights to be gained. So that decision will be made and announced at the proper time. I am not a big fan of using code words or language to signal or pre-announce policy decisions before they have been made. But, I do believe it is important that any monetary policy decisions, and the context underlying them   whether they are policy changes or not   are clearly explained. ###newline### Finally, I do not believe the MPC is necessarily obliged to delay any policy moves until we have certainty over the exact shape of Brexit and its long-run effects on the economy. We make our decisions from meeting to meeting, and will fulfil our remit during the Brexit process and after it. Any policy decision carries risks that subsequent events make the decision controversial, but that is always the case. Perceptions of the economic outlook have already changed markedly in recent months and may well continue to do so. It is natural for policy to respond to the changing outlook if needed, consistent with our low inflation remit. ###newline### Note: In the left chart, spreads are measured as the average spread over swap rates on -year fixed mortgages with % LTV.
