Financial markets##NewPara##The most notable event in financial markets since the Committee s June meeting had been the  basis point increase in US official interest rates by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). But this had been widely anticipated and thus had had little immediate impact on financial markets. Otherwise there had been little significant news on the month. Short-term interest rates had fallen in the major economies. In the United Kingdom, this appeared to have been mainly a response to weaker-than-expected US data, UK housing market data and the Committee s June Minutes.##NewPara##Longer-term nominal forward rates had also fallen a little, and by somewhat more in the United States than in the United Kingdom and the euro area. Most of the rise in longer-term US and euro-area forward inflation expectations in the previous month had also unwound. Implied longer-term inflation expectations in the United Kingdom had been more stable throughout that period.##NewPara##Exchange rate movements between the major currencies had been small, with the US dollar depreciating a little against sterling and the euro. The sterling effective exchange rate index had fallen slightly since the Committee s June meeting and had been broadly unchanged since February.##NewPara##Equity indices had fallen in the major economies in local currency terms, with the FTSE All- Share .% lower.##NewTopic##The international economy##NewPara##News about the world economy over the past month had been limited and rather mixed. But it did not change the overall picture of a broadening upswing in activity, consistent with the May Inflation Report projections.##NewPara##In the euro area, the pickup in economic growth appeared to have gained momentum, with private sector final domestic demand in Italy stronger than expected. Euro-area retail sales had fallen in May, but this was a volatile series. Euro-area industrial production had increased in April, the third consecutive monthly rise. And though the purchasing ma nagers  indices for manufacturing and services had eased back slightly in June, the European Commission survey of business confidence had picked up a little, pointing to continued growth in the near future.##NewPara##Output growth in Germany continued to rest heavily on exports. A key issue was whether and when the pickup in euro-area domestic demand would spread there. German retail sales had fallen in May and consumer confidence remained low. That appeared to reflect concerns about employment prospects, in part associated with structural reforms .##NewPara##The flash estimate of euro-area HICP inflation had eased in June from .% to .%. Underlying inflationary pressures appeared subdued.##NewPara##The US economic recovery appeared to be continuing, although perhaps at a slightly less brisk pace. Estimated GDP growth in  Q had been revised down slightly. Industrial production had risen strongly in May; but both the Institute for Supply Management s headline indices had eased back in June, though they remained at high levels.##NewPara##US consumer confidence had risen markedly in June, probably reflecting the improved jobs market. The increase in non-farm payrolls in June had been lower than in previous months. But this was a volatile series and the overall picture was one of substantial employment gains this year. Industrial capacity utilisation was rising and though the core measure of consumer price inflation had fallen in May, inflationary pressures appeared to be increasing, with producer price inflation at its highest level since December .##NewPara##The recovery in Japan had continued. Industrial production had risen in May and the June Tankan survey had suggested a further improvement in business confidence. Unemployment had fallen. Recovery had been helped by the strength of exports to China.##NewPara##The spot price of crude oil had been volatile during the month, with the price of Brent crude ending .% higher in sterling terms . Prices had fallen earlier in June following an announcement of##NewPara##increased OPEC production, but had risen later in the month following new uncertainties about Iraqi, Russian and Nigerian output. This underlined the potential sensitivity of prices to instability in oil- producing regions, though futures prices had been steadier. Prices of other commodities had, on average, fallen in sterling terms since the Committee s June meeting.##NewTopic##Money, credit, demand and output##NewPara##In the United Kingdom, output and demand growth appeared to have continued at around, or a little above, trend so far in . Revisions to the National Accounts, consistent with the  Blue Book, had suggested a more balanced pattern of domestic demand growth, with weaker private sector consumption growth and stronger investment. There had been further tentative signs of a slowdown in the housing market.##NewPara##The underlying annual growth rate of notes and coins had probably eased in recent months, perhaps consistent with slower consumption growth, although three-month annualised growth rates had recently picked up again. Broad money growth had edged up, but remained consistent with steady growth in aggregate nominal demand. Growth of total lending to individuals had remained rapid.##NewPara##Following the Blue Book revisions to the National Accounts, the estimated level of GDP at basic prices had been revised up by .%, with growth over the past year revised up from .% to .%. This change was more than accounted for by upward revisions to ONS estimates of real government output, including the new measures of real government health output. Estimates of nominal government spending had not changed significantly. What mattered for inflationary pressure in the economy, however, was not the estimated volume of public sector output but rather the quantity of resources that the public sector absorbed and how that affected the ability of the private sector to meet the demand for its goods and services. It was not obvious that these revisions represented any news about the real value of resources absorbed by government and therefore about prospective inflationary pressures.##NewPara##The ONS had estimated output growth at basic prices in  Q to have been .%, unchanged from the previous release. Manufacturing output was estimated to have contracted by .%. Survey data had pointed to more buoyant manufacturing activity in the first quarter, and the ONS had reported a rise in manufacturing output of .% in May, following the rise of .% in April, suggesting that the##NewPara##official and survey data were now moving back in line. Survey evidence suggested continued strength in the near future, but perhaps moderating slightly. The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) surveys of business activity in manufacturing and services had both fallen in June but remained at healthy levels. And the Bank s regional Agents had reported a gradual improvement in manufacturing activity and an increase in service sector output growth.##NewPara##Turning to the components of demand, the Blue Book had included material downward revisions to estimated real consumption growth since . Consumption growth in  Q had been revised downwards to .% and investment growth upwards to .%. Growth in the economy therefore appeared to have been more balanced. But the new profile of consumption growth was difficult to interpret. The revisions for earlier quarters reflected increases in the deflator rather than falls in the estimated nominal value of consumption, following the rebasing of the post- data. And the weaker growth in consumption in  Q and  Q was mainly accounted for by falls in estimated nominal consumption of services, particularly the net balance of tourist expenditure, which was reported to have fallen sharply. This helped to explain the contrast with strong retail sales growth in  Q, but painted a rather different picture from the service sector output data and surveys of consumer services. Taking the evidence together, the Committee judged that consumption might have grown a little more quickly in  Q than estimated by the ONS.##NewPara##Retail sales growth had remained strong in May. But there had also been signs that consumption growth in  Q might have been slower than expected in the May Inflation Report projections.##NewPara##The reported volume of sales in the CBI distributive trades survey had fallen slightly in June, although the survey continued to point to strong sales growth. Private car registrations had been lower than a year earlier in  Q. Growth rates of unsecured lending had eased again in May, although the annual and three-month (annualised) growth rates remained above %. The GfK consumer confidence balance had fallen slightly in June, with a decline in the reported willingness to make a major purchase.##NewPara##In the housing market, the average of the Nationwide and Halifax house price indices had increased by .% in the three months to June, down from .% in the three months to May. Nevertheless, the level of house prices was a little above that envisaged in the May Inflation Report. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) survey of estate agents for June had suggested that the balance of respondents was no longer expecting prices to rise over the next three months.##NewPara##There were also further signs that activity might be easing. The June RICS survey had shown a fall in the reported ratio of estate agents  sales to unsold stocks for the third consecutive month. The Bank s Agents had reported a slowdown in buy-to-let purchases in the south of England, although the housing market was said to remain strong in the north of England. Nonetheless, these indicators remained tentative. Activity had slowed on previous occasions in the recent past but picked up again strongly after a pause, most notably in  H.##NewTopic##The labour market, costs and prices##NewPara##The labour market had continued to tighten gradually, consistent with the May Inflation Report##NewPara##According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), employment had risen by , in the three months to April, leaving the employment rate unchanged at %. The unemployment rate, at .% on the LFS measure, remained at levels not seen since the mid-s. Though the REC survey and the Bank s Agents had suggested a tightening labour market, some other surveys in the spring had not suggested increased recruitment difficulties; the Confederation of British Industry manufacturing surveys of skilled and unskilled labour shortages remained around their average levels since , significantly below the peaks in the early s and late s. It was possible that immigration was acting as a safety valve to limit pressure. And the market might have become more efficient at matching unemployed workers to unfilled vacancies.##NewPara##Overall earnings growth had been .% in the three months ending in April compared with the same period a year earlier. Private sector wage settlements had continued to increase on a year earlier, although this trend was less evident when settlements this year could be matched with the corresponding settlements last year. Furthermore, annual growth in regular pay per hour had remained stable. But to identify recent trends it was also informative to look at the three-month-on-previous- three-month comparison. This showed wage settlements falling a little in both the private and public sectors. But, on this measure, the annualised rate of private sector regular pay growth had risen to .%. This recent difference between wage settlements and regular pay growth (pay drift) might have different explanations. Employers might be paying new people more in order to recruit in a tight labour market or promoting existing people into more highly paid jobs in order to retain them. If so, wage settlements might understate underlying inflationary pressures. But if pay were increasingly##NewPara##linked to performance and productivity growth, the consequences for inflationary pressures might be more benign.##NewPara##CPI inflation had risen by . percentage points to .% in May. In line with pre-release arrangements, an advance estimate of CPI inflation in June had been provided to the Governor   working days ahead of publication, and this suggested a further rise to .%. This pickup in inflation reflected in part sharp falls in petrol prices a year ago. As this effect dropped out of the annual comparison, it was likely that CPI inflation would be a little lower over the next few months.##NewPara##The ONS measures of annual manufacturing output and input price inflation had risen in May. Surveys had been suggesting a pickup in inflationary pressures down the supply chain over the past few months. The output price balance from the CIPS services survey had risen again in June, to levels similar to those in , and the expected output price balance from the CBI monthly trends enquiry had also been rising. In part, the surveys may have been reflecting the impact of higher oil prices.##NewPara##Over the past year, manufacturers  costs, using a weighted measure of input prices and unit labour costs, had been increasing less rapidly than their output prices (excluding duties), reversing the pattern seen through  and much of . It seemed that manufacturers had been taking the opportunity of the upturn in economic activity to rebuild margins, suggesting that the previous falls might have been cyclical. A survey by the Bank s Agents had found that the balance of manufacturers expected profit margins to increase slightly in the next six months with the main factor being improved demand for products.  In the distribution sector, annual RPIY goods price inflation had been lower than the inflation in distributors  weighted costs for most of the period since , possibly reflecting a structural squeeze on wholesalers  margins.##NewTopic##Other considerations##NewPara##According to the most recent Reuters poll, of the  economists surveyed,  expected no change in the repo rate this month and one expected a  basis point increase. The mean probability attached to no change was %. Of the  economists who expected the repo rate to remain unchanged at this meeting,  expected it to be raised in August. The mean expectation of the repo rate at the end of  was now .%. This was consistent with anecdotal evidence from market participants and the pattern of very short-term interest rates.##NewTopic##The immediate policy decision##NewPara##There had been little significant news on the month. Financial markets had been quiet, with the  basis point rise in US official rates by the FOMC fully anticipated. The world economic upswing remained on track. Growth in the euro area continued to gather momentum, although the German economy remained weak. US growth continued, although perhaps at a slightly less brisk pace. The recovery in Japan seemed well established and the rest of Asia was growing strongly.##NewPara##In the United Kingdom, output and demand growth appeared to have continued at around or a little above trend in the first half of the year. Strong manufacturing output growth in April and May suggested that the ONS estimates of GDP growth for  Q might be stronger than for  Q, which had been weaker than expected given the survey evidence. Following the Blue Book revisions to the National Accounts, the estimated level of GDP had been revised upwards. But the increase was more than accounted for by higher estimates of real government output and did not materially alter the Committee s view of inflationary pressures in the economy. The weaker ONS estimate of real consumption growth in  Q was difficult to reconcile with other indicators and the Committee judged that consumption might have grown a little more quickl y in the first quarter than currently estimated. However, there were also signs of more moderate consumption growth in  Q. There had been further tentative signs of a slowdown in the housing market, although house prices were nevertheless above the level envisaged in the May Inflation Report projections. Labour market conditions continued to tighten gradually. The near-term outlook for CPI inflation was that it would remain below the target.##NewPara##Overall, the broad economic outlook had not changed very much since the May Inflation Report. The immediate prospect for domestic demand was perhaps a little weaker, with some signs of more moderate consumption growth. But growth was still around or a little above trend and there appeared to be little, if any, spare capacity.##NewPara##Against this background, the Committee considered possible arguments for a rise of  basis points in the repo rate this month. First, the May Inflation Report central projection had been for inflation at the forecast horizon to be a little above target if official rates rose in line with the path of market interest rates obtaining at that time. It was likely that the repo rate would need to increase##NewPara##further and, with little remaining spare capacity, there was no compelling reason for delay. Second, the case for moving cautiously was less relevant now that the interest rate cycle had clearly turned, despite some continuing uncertainty about the response of highly indebted households to higher rates. Third, the labour market continued to tighten gradually and there was some evidence of pressures building down the supply chain. Past episodes suggested that regular pay and settlements could pick up rapidly if inflationary pressures were allowed to build. But inflation expectations presently seemed well anchored.##NewPara##The Committee, however, thought that the arguments for keeping rates unchanged were more persuasive. First, the May Inflation Report central projection, based on the market yield curve, was for inflation to be below target for most of the forecast period, only rising slightly above target at the end. Since the recent increases in the repo rate reflected a movement at least as fast as that implied by the May market curve, there was no argument for a third successive rise. Indeed, there was a risk that an unexpected rate increase, in the absence of significant news on the month, might prompt an unwarranted re-evaluation of the Committee s strategy by market participants. Second, the August Inflation Report would provide an opportunity to evaluate the news since May more fully in the context of producing a new forecast and to consider further some key economic issues, such as the recent and prospective pattern of consumption and the pressure of government demand on resources.##NewPara##The Governor invited members to vote on the proposition that the repo rate should be maintained at .%. The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the proposition.
