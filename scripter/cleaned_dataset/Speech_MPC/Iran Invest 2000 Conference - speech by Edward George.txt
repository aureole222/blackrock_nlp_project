I am delighted to be able to take part in this conference, and particularly pleased to be sharing the platform this morning with Governor Mohsen Nourbakhsh of the Central Bank of Iran, Bank Markazi. ###newline### I first met Governor Nourbakhsh soon after he became Governor in  - which was not an easy time for Iran. I was immediately impressed not only by his command of the issues confronting him - which was perhaps not surprising: it was his second period in office as Governor, having in the meantime taken a vacation as Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance, and as Deputy to the President, with responsibility for Economic Affairs. But I was immediately impressed too by his calm and always reasoned approach and by his reliability. He has played an important role in steering his country through a difficult period to the more promising prospect that Iran faces today. Since our first meeting, I have very much enjoyed the opportunity of seeing the Governor periodically at a whole series of international meetings, and it is a very great pleasure, Mohsen, to be able to join in welcoming you here to London this morning. I have been immensely interested in - and greatly encouraged by - what you have had to tell us. ###newline### Perhaps I might add a few observations of my own - from my inevitably more distant perspective. ###newline### For much of the past two or three years the external environment facing Iran was a difficult one. The slowdown in world economic growth in the wake of the global financial crisis and the associated fall in oil prices - to an unsustainably low level - significantly weakened the financial positions of all major oil-exporting countries. Iran was no exception. The current account swung from a surplus of .% of GDP in / to a deficit of over %. And the fiscal position deteriorated to a deficit of .% of GDP. ###newline### But Iran's response to worsening economic conditions was a positive one. The authorities began to formulate a medium- term reform strategy, which has now been articulated as the Third Five Year Development Plan. Since then, the combination of sound economic management at home, coupled with continued economic expansion in the industrial countries and rising oil prices, have improved Iran's prospects considerably. ###newline### The IMF forecast GDP growth of .% in Iran in /. The external account has strengthened, with a surplus of .% of GDP recorded in /. And the budgetary position swung from deficit to a surplus of % of GDP in /. ###newline### Foreign exchange reserves have risen by $ billion to $ billion since /. Although inflation remains still quite high at around %, broad money growth has shown signs of moderating. Debt levels are also now below the average for emerging market economies. Perhaps above all else, it is encouraging that the authorities have not rested on their laurels, but have instead sought to take advantage of this recent more favourable economic environment to increase the momentum of reform. The overall macro-economic prospect, therefore, is a positive one. ###newline### Iran is, of course, OPEC's second largest producer and has the second largest reserves of gas in the world. It has benefited from the recent rise in oil prices and is playing a positive role in promoting the stability of the oil market. President Khatami recently noted that OPEC may need to raise output in proportion to the increase in global oil demand to stabilise prices. ###newline### The government has taken positive steps to encourage foreign investment in the petroleum sector. For example, they have facilitated foreign participation in contracts to redevelop oil fields, and they have also signed an agreement with a consortium of nine leading international oil and gas companies to study Iran's potential as an exporter of gas. ###newline### The government is, moreover, actively seeking to cushion the economy from future fluctuations in the oil price. Establishing an Oil Stabilisation Fund, which ensures that the government balance sheet is strengthened when oil price movements are favourable, should help insure against the type of debt servicing problems faced by many emerging ###newline### A key step in this regard has been the joint IMF-World Bank initiative of Financial Sector Assessment Programs, or FSAPs. The FSAP process is designed to identify and assess strengths and weaknesses in financial systems from a best practice standpoint including: assessing financial institutions' structure and soundness; reviewing systemic risks in payment systems; examining the legal framework and the system of official oversight and prudential regulation and supervision; and assessing institutional arrangements for crisis management, including financial safety nets. Iran is addressing these aspects of the financial infrastructure and, in formulating and implementing their reform programme, Iran has maintained a constructive engagement with the IFIs. I am particularly pleased that the Bank of England will be involved with an IMF-World Bank led technical assistance team on financial sector restructuring and supervisory and regulatory frameworks for banks in Iran during the coming year. ###newline### Another key element of efforts to strengthen the international financial architecture has been the development and implementation of a range of international standards or codes of good practice. These codes are not meant to lay down strict or inflexible rules. They are designed, however, to promote best practices, while recognising that financial systems are likely to differ across countries and across time. The IMF and the World Bank, working together with the relevant standard-setting bodies, have been helping economies undertake assessments of their observance of some of these standards. ###newline### Iran is currently working towards the adoption of internationally accepted best practice standards in a number of areas. The central bank is developing a new bank accounting framework, which represents a move towards international accounting standards, while taking account of the special features of Islamic finance. The authorities are also developing an action plan for implementing supervision reforms. These developments ought to be good news for prospective investors in Iran. They also help illustrate that international best practice standards can be flexible enough to accommodate individual country circumstances. ###newline### The move to a more market-oriented environment brings with it new challenges. For example, liberalising exchange controls and freeing the exchange rate to market forces brings risks as well as opportunities. A sequenced approach to capital account liberalisation helps mitigate these risks and that is the route Iran has pursued. But that is not to say reform has stalled. ###newline### Exchange rate unification and the partial liberalisation of trade and exchange controls will make greater demands on the effectiveness of monetary policy. For example, monetary expansion may arise from the phased reduction in banks' reserve requirements. It will be important for the central bank to develop effective monetary instruments to sterilise the monetary impact of these reforms, and support the central bank's target for inflation. The issuance of CDs, together with the partial liberalisation of credit allocation, are all sensible and commendable steps. And I know that the central bank is actively considering additional possibilities. These measures will make for a financial system in Iran that is more efficient, liquid and transparent - and thereby more attractive to potential market entrants. ###newline### Mr Chairman, economic progress in any one country is not just a question of that country's national interest, it is - in today's increasingly economically and financially integrated world - a matter of collective, international, interest. That is true both at the macro- and at the micro-economic level - the level of individual businesses and firms. That's why I think it is important that we encourage the forces working for reform and liberalisation by engaging constructively with them. Iran has embarked upon an ambitious, but realistically measured, programme of reform and liberalisation through the Third Five-Year Development Plan, and it is taking advantage of the present more favourable conditions in the world economy ###newline### to advance that programme. I wish you, Governor Nourbakhsh, and the authorities in Iran all possible success in achieving your objectives in the interests of the Iranian people and in the interest of us all.
