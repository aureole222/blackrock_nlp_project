Jackson Hole speakers normally draw out the lessons of economic theory for one specific area of policy. But this year we are trying to distil lessons from the practice of monetary policy in the United States - over an extraordinarily successful quarter century under the leadership of Alan Greenspan   for the theory of monetary policy. ###newline### At most celebrations of a long and successful career, invited speakers talk at length and the great man himself is allowed a few minutes at the end. It is a remarkable tribute to Alan that on this occasion the tradition has been turned on its head. We all remain intrigued by what he has to say. In the few minutes I am allowed, I want to describe the three important lessons that I have learnt from Alan during my time at the Bank of England. ###newline### First, to be a successful central banker requires an extraordinary degree of objectivity. The key is to recognise that economics tells you how to think, not what to think.It is not a set of settled conclusions about issues. Above all, it is vital never to confuse the world with a model. The whole point of a model is to abstract from a wide range of factors in order to think clearly about one particular issue. ###newline### The second lesson from Alan s time at the Federal Reserve is that empirical knowledge is not confined to the econometric analysis of official statistics. There are other and often ###newline### crucially important pieces of information that come to us in more qualitative form. These include information from businesses about what they see happening in the economy. ###newline### But we have had many examples of the importance of qualitative data in making judgements. For instance, there have been significant flows of migration that have expanded the potential labour force. By their nature, such flows are not accurately reflected in official data. But the Bank of England s business contacts were able to tell us that the ability to recruit new migrant workers was a growing and significant response to a tight labour market. ###newline### The third lesson that Alan has taught us is that it is the consistency over time of a policy framework that sustains a market economy, as the achievements of the United States over the last  years show very clearly. Alan, of course, has stressed this in the context of price stability. But it applies equally well to the system of taxes, property rights and public goods provision on which prosperity in a market economy relies. Alan famously defined price stability in the following terms:  price stability is best thought of as an environment in which inflation is so low and stable over time that it does not materially enter into the decisions of households and firms.   I would suggest that implicit in this is a prescription that Alan might write for all economic policies, not just monetary policy: namely, that economic policy stability is best thought of as an environment in which the decisions of ###newline### households and firms are not materially affected by the need to insure against future arbitrary or mischievous changes in government policy. Just as Alan would define a good monetary policy as one which leads people to stop talking about inflation, I think he would call a good tax policy one under which people stop talking about the tax system. ###newline### In the last decade we have had a debate about whether such stability should be implemented by quantitative targets or not. In monetary policy we have seen the spread of  inflation targets , and targets have begun to permeate other areas of economic policy too. You will not be surprised to learn that I think that such numerical targets have a role. But whether they are appropriate or not is a subsidiary question, and it is one that is related to the political economy of how to ensure the transparency of policy, the accountability of those responsible for it, and the way in which households and firms form expectations of policy: monetary, fiscal or other. Since the political economy varies from one country to another, so will the appropriate method of achieving price stability in particular, and economic policy stability in general. The crucial and overriding point is that a market economy cannot flourish if policymakers behave in ways that lead private agents to expect future economic policies   be those future monetary, fiscal, or legal policies   to be subject to arbitrary or capricious changes. ###newline### Of course, an expectation of a stable regime will rarely translate into stable outcomes, and it would be irresponsible of policymakers to let such a misconception take hold.A well designed set of institutions will lead to responses being predictable, but cannot guarantee that outcomes will be. ###newline### And there is a pressing issue here. In the US, inflation has been both low and rather stable. Over the past decade it has varied between .% and .%, so we can with some justification say that inflation no longer  materially enter[s] into the decisions of households and firms.  In the UK inflation has, if anything, been even more stable. But this success carries a risk for the future. Inflation expectations may be sensitive to a large but temporary shock that moved inflation outside the range within which it has remained for some years. With their belief in stability jolted, households  inflation expectations might move by much more than was justified by the temporary nature of the shock. That would make it more difficult for the central bank to bring inflation back to target. The moral of this particular story is that it may be risky to infer from the observation that ###newline### inflation expectations are stable that all is well. There will be times when large and persistent shocks occur, and it would be unwise to count on inflation expectations remaining stable when actual inflation starts to deviate substantially from its recent range. ###newline### So those are the three lessons that I have learnt from Alan: (i) a recognition that economics is not a set of doctrines but a way of thinking; (ii) the importance of using qualitative and quantitative information from a range of sources; (iii) there are a small number of fundamental objectives that are crucial and which we can judge by the Greenspan yardstick of whether we have freed businesses and households from the burden of expending resources to deal with unnecessary policy volatility. ###newline### Alan s departure from the central banking scene will deprive us of a source of wisdom, inspiration and leadership. To be sure, Alan s words, whether spoken or written, will surely still reach us from the sidelines. To use a tennis analogy, I see Alan as the central banking equivalent of the non-playing captain of a Davis Cup team, encouraging the younger and less talented members, and stressing the importance of footwork, timing and getting into position early. ###newline### Alan, thank you for raising the respect which others give to our discipline of economics and our profession of central banking.
