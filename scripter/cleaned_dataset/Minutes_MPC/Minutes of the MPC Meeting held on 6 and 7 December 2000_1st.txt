The world economy##NewPara##The news over the month suggested a rather more pronounced slowdown in the world economy, particularly in the United States, than in the central projection in the November Inflation Report.##NewPara##The issues were how fast this deceleration would be, to what extent any faster-than-expected slowdown would be offset by adjustments in monetary policy, and the implications of slower world growth for inflation prospects in the United Kingdom.##NewPara##Although the slowdown in the United States now seemed rather greater than had earlier been expected, some moderation in US growth was necessary (and indeed welcome) if demand were not to outstrip productive capacity and put upwards pressure on prices. The extent of the slowdown required to bring the economy into balance would depend on the sustainable rate of growth in the United States, and in particular on how far the recent increase in productivity growth was a result of structural improvements, rather than cyclical factors. If the use of information technology outside the IT sector delivered further productivity gains, growth in potential supply might remain relatively rapid for some time to come. Estimates of the sustainable rate of growth were inevitably uncertain. But the greater the productive capacity of the economy, the less demand would need to slow to restrain inflationary pressures.##NewPara##Recent US data pointed to a moderation in the pace of growth. Estimates of GDP growth in Q had been revised down slightly to .%. Manufacturing output and retail sales were up only a little in October; more recently chainstore sales had been weak. The latest survey from the National Association of Purchasing Managers showed another small fall in the index, which was at its lowest level for two years, while growth in non-farm payrolls continued to slow. Share prices had been volatile, but had fallen over the month, with consumer confidence declining and some evidence of a##NewPara##further tightening in credit conditions over the past quarter in the Federal Reserve Senior Officer Loan Survey.##NewPara##Since early June, credit spreads for lower-rated borrowers had widened sharply in the United States. Staff analysis suggested that this might reflect firm-specific or sectoral factors rather than broader influences; sharp increases in spreads had been more prevalent in the communications and technology, and electronic, sectors. A differentiated pattern of this sort was typical of a period of rapid structural change, in which some firms were  winners  and others lost out, resulting in spreads increasing on average. But spreads would also widen in a general economic downturn, with the risk of default increasing for financially weaker companies. If confidence fell sharply while spreads were increasing, the  soft landing  might prove rather bumpy.##NewPara##Computers, communications equipment and semiconductors continued to account for most of the increase in US manufacturing output. Orders data, however, suggested a deceleration in demand might be in prospect, raising the possibility of future overcapacity in these sectors. Equity prices for such companies had also moved sharply. While the NASDAQ index was still higher than it had been for most of , it had fallen % since mid-March . This might have implications for other parts of the US economy, both via confidence and wealth effects. That said, expectations of growth in earnings per share remained quite strong, at around % for the next year according to the recent Merrill Lynch survey of fund managers.##NewPara##While movements in the NASDAQ index would not of themselves generate significant wealth effects, this was not the case for equity markets taken as a whole. Indeed, the previous rise in equity prices might well explain part of the fall in the US saving ratio. Now that wealth was no longer rising as a result of increasing equity prices, this might lead (once the lags had worked through) to a greater propensity to save out of current income. And if market participants revised down their estimates of trend productivity growth, equity prices might fall still further. It was recognised that consensus expectations of corporate earnings growth, although currently remaining strong, sometimes failed to signal a prospective downturn. If so, GDP growth could fall sharply, especially if inventories were cut back. In such circumstances, however, the Federal Reserve would have scope to adjust monetary policy accordingly, provided inflationary pressures were subdued.##NewPara##The Committee agreed that while the downside risks to growth in the United States, acknowledged in its November projections, had increased over the past month, the most likely prospect was still for moderate growth rather than recession.##NewPara##Within the euro area, GDP growth was likely to be lower in Q than in the previous quarter. The purchasing managers  indices in Germany and France had continued to fall, although these remained above the neutral  level. At the same time, consumer price inflation remained well above %, and the core inflation measure had risen to .%. The recent fall in oil prices, if sustained, might reduce inflationary pressures in the euro area while helping to support domestic demand. If the euro exchange rate recovered against the dollar in response to slower growth in the United States, this would also help to contain inflation, although it would adversely affect the contribution to growth from net trade, which was likely to be influenced in any case by the slowdown in the world economy.##NewPara##In Japan, GDP growth remained anaemic, at .% in Q, with the figure for Q having been revised down from .% to .%, following changes to the methodology used to produce the national accounts. Equity prices and bond yields had fallen, perhaps suggesting some faltering in expectations of a recovery in domestic demand. The export sector was vulnerable to any sharp slowdown in world demand, or a significant depreciation of the dollar against the yen.##NewPara##There had been signs of fragility in Argentina and Turkey over the past month, but these appeared to reflect the particular circumstances in these countries; so far markets seemed to be differentiating between the emerging market economies more than in  and . Nevertheless, there was a risk that if growth in the United States, and in world trade more generally, slowed by more than expected, the emerging market economies as a whole might be more significantly affected. Within this group, equity prices in Asia had fallen steeply, and the (very rapid) growth rates in industrial production there had begun to moderate; this area was heavily dependent on exports of electronic goods to the United States. Nevertheless, Consensus GDP growth forecasts for these countries in  had been revised down only a little, and their external liquidity positions were in most cases more firmly based than they had been in .##NewPara##The spot price for oil had fallen by around % over the past month, but it remained volatile and longer-dated futures prices had declined by less. While there were various short-term factors at##NewPara##work, the more fundamental influence was probably the deceleration in world activity, and the expectation that the demand for oil would slow, at least in the near term. If sustained, the fallback in oil prices would reduce the upside risks to inflation, and moderate the decline in the prospects for world economic growth.##NewPara##The Committee noted the significant fall in money market and government bond yields in the major industrial economies over the past month. The movements in short yields could be explained by cyclical factors, and the falls in longer yields did not seem to result from changes in inflation expectations; they might instead reflect a widespread downgrading of longer-term growth prospects.##NewPara##If the world economy slowed by more than projected in the November Inflation Report, there would be a negative impact on UK growth, and hence on inflation.  If the slowdown led to downward pressure on the prices of commodities and other imports, this would restrain inflation further. But if a sharper-than-expected slowdown in the United States led to a fall in the dollar against the euro, the overall impact on the United Kingdom would depend on how sterling reacted to such a move. If, for instance, it rose against the dollar, but fell back against the euro, then the much greater importance of the euro area for UK trade might mean that sterling s effective exchange rate would fall. This would tend to offset, at least in part, the dampening effect on UK prices and activity that would otherwise result from slower growth in world demand.##NewTopic##Money, credit and asset prices##NewPara##Growth in M remained strong, although the twelve-month rate had fallen back to .% if deposits by other financial corporations (OFCs) were excluded. Similarly, growth in M lending remained robust at .%, but excluding OFCs had fallen back to .%. Lending to private##NewPara##non-financial corporations (PNFCs) had risen by almost  % over the past year.##NewPara##M lending to households continued to grow at close to % a year, with unsecured lending still growing much faster than this. Annual growth in secured lending was little changed, at almost %. While on a year-on-year basis the rate of increase in house prices continued to fall on most measures, over a shorter horizon some of these measures showed a pick-up in growth over the past few months. Provisional data from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors  (RICS) survey for November suggested an increase in the balance of estate agents reporting rises in house prices over the past##NewPara##three months, particularly in the south. Housing market activity appeared to be broadly flat, but the value of loans approved continued to grow strongly, reflecting remortgaging activity. Meanwhile mortgage equity withdrawal had fallen from  . billion in Q to a preliminary estimate of##NewPara## . billion in Q. This was still high by the standards of the past eight years, and was not unexpected given the recent increase in net housing equity, and stronger competition in the mortgage market.##NewPara##The Committee discussed the implications of these figures for consumption, which had been higher than expected in  Q, and was % up on a year ago (compared with .% in the year to  Q). House prices had risen sharply during ; as a result, whether or not house price inflation was increasing now, homeowners already had considerable collateral against which to borrow, as evidenced by the figures for mortgage equity withdrawal. So far as the remortgaging data were concerned, it was unclear whether borrowers were simply switching between lenders in response to the increasingly competitive terms being offered, or whether at the same time they were increasing their mortgages. More fundamentally, the borrowing figures suggested that consumers still remained confident about their employment and earnings prospects.##NewPara##Since the previous MPC meeting, interest rate expectations, as implied by short sterling futures contracts, had fallen sharply: by  basis points or more by the second half of . Taken by it self this represented an easing of monetary conditions. In addition, the sterling effective exchange rate index had fallen by around  %, and was now % below the path assumed in the November Inflation Report. This depreciation could not be explained by movements in interest rate differentials.##NewPara##Sterling had moved less than the euro, which had appreciated by over % against the dollar since the Committee s previous meeting, after falling in the first half of the month. This recovery in the euro appeared consistent with a downgrading of growth prospects in the United States, and perhaps also with some moderation in global mergers and acquisitions activity.##NewTopic##Demand and output##NewPara##GDP was estimated to have increased by .% in Q, unrevised from the preliminary release, and close to its average growth rate over the past year. More recently the Department of the##NewPara##Environment, Transport and the Regions had released new figures for construction output in Q which, taken by themselves, implied that output growth might be revised down to .%. At this stage indicators for Q were for growth at much the same rate.##NewPara##The Committee noted that a substantial decrease in the rate of growth of private spending had been incorporated in the central projection of the November Inflation Report. Since then, the uncertainties had probably increased. The news in the National Accounts data for Q related mainly to the composition of demand. Consumption growth was stronger than expected, and as yet showed little signs of slowing as forecast in the November Inflation Report. But investment and government consumption had not grown as rapidly as projected, and so final domestic demand had grown a little slower than in Q, at .%.##NewPara##The Committee discussed the implications of these figures for the path of output over the next few quarters. Some members placed more weight on the continuing buoyancy of consumption; others emphasised the relative weakness in the growth of other components of final domestic demand, in particular investment, and in addition the risk that stockbuilding might fall back.##NewPara##To date, consumption had continued to grow at around % a year.  When taken together with the household borrowing figures, high (and rising) house prices and a tight labour market this suggested continuing momentum in the economy. Consumption was by far the largest component of domestic demand and perhaps also one of the less erratic elements. Growth in real incomes and employment had recently begun to slow, and lower share prices had reduced financial wealth a little. These influences would tend to restrain consumption. The question was whether the deceleration would be as marked as in the central projection in the November Inflation Report.##NewPara##Retail sales volumes had been flat in October, but private car registrations had grown quite strongly in October and November; sales of new cars to the personal sector were included in consumption but not in retail sales. Surveys were mixed. The CBI Distributive Trades survey for November had shown a surprisingly weak picture for the motor trades, but a sharp recovery in retail volumes, as well as in distribution and wholesaling; all three of these were close to their September levels, having fallen sharply in October. The three-month average measure of retail volumes had declined from the high levels recorded at the turn of the millennium, although the latest three-month period included the (possibly erratically low) October figure. The GfK consumer confidence survey,##NewPara##conducted early in November, showed a small fall (perhaps related to uncertainty concerning possible fuel protests) while the MORI index had recovered quite sharply. But reports from the Bank s regional Agents suggested that there was as yet little sign of a slowdown in consumption.##NewPara##Investment had again grown more slowly than expected. In Q the level of investment was unchanged, once net acquisitions of valuables were excluded. This raised some doubts as to whether investment would grow as rapidly as projected in the November Report. The Bank s regional Agents were now reporting some caution among their contacts about investment plans, not just in manufacturing but also in services, reflecting overcapacity in sectors such as leisure. Profit warnings were up on a year ago, particularly in the IT sector; some companies were faced with less favourable financing conditions now that their equity prices had fallen and credit spreads had widened.  Once the oil sector was excluded, both gross and net rates of return for PNFCs had declined since##NewPara## Q. But the level of investment as a share of GDP remained high by historical standards, at least on the basis of constant price measures.##NewPara##Government consumption had grown by .% in Q, well down on its growth rate in the previous quarter, suggesting that unless there were to be a marked acceleration in spending in the next two quarters, departments would spend less than had been planned for this financial year. If public spending were to continue to grow more slowly than forecast, there would be more time for private spending to slow without the overall growth in demand placing excessive strains on the productive capacity of the economy.##NewPara##In recent quarters stockbuilding had risen quite sharply; in the year to  Q changes in stockbuilding had accounted for . percentage points of the .% increase in GDP. If this rise was predicated on expected increases in final demand, stockbuilding could fall sharply if these expectations were not fulfilled. In that sense the inventory cycle represented a downside risk to activity.##NewPara##Surveys by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) showed stronger output growth in manufacturing, while in services the CIPS index remained at , well above the neutral  level. However, the CBI Deloitte and Touche Services Survey suggested that while volumes continued to rise, particularly in consumer services, optimism had fallen, with the decline most marked in business and professional services.##NewPara##Leading indicators for the United Kingdom pointed to a slowdown in growth continuing into . Since these indicators were built up from information which was already available to the Committee, such as equity prices, confidence measures and new car sales, some members were not inclined to put much weight on them: to do so ran the risk of double counting. For others, leading indicators could be used to improve the projections of most UK macroeconomic models, and had done so over a long period. Such indicators therefore provided a useful cross-check to the forecast.##NewTopic##The labour market##NewPara##The latest quantities data suggested that the labour market remained tight, but might be turning. Growth in employment, as measured by the Labour Force Survey (LFS), had slowed steadily from , in the three months to May to under , in Q. The underlying deceleration might be even greater: new population estimates had been used to gross up the latest data, and the effect was to increase measured employment in Q relative to earlier quarters. Claimant count unemployment had risen slightly in October, and while LFS unemployment had fallen by , in Q compared with Q, it had risen compared with the three months to August. Overall labour input, as measured by total hours worked per week, was up only .% on a year ago. Survey data, however, did not point to a major change in the demand for staff from employers.##NewPara##There was little new information on pay settlements, and the Average Earnings Index continued to grow at not much above %, with regular pay (ie, excluding bonuses) growing at a similar rate. If anything, the rate of growth of regular pay appeared to have eased a little since May.##NewPara##The Committee agreed that it would be important to monitor settlements in the new year closely to see how far, if at all, they began to reflect pressures on recruitment and retention and higher RPI (rather than RPIX) inflation. While a survey by Industrial Relations Services (IRS) suggested no sharp escalation in pay deals was likely over the next year, another by Incomes Data Services pointed to more upward pressure on settlements than for some time. The Bank s own survey, carried out by its regional Agents, suggested that % of employers expected settlements to be higher in  than , with % expecting them to be lower; the majority of respondents expected no change or had no company-wide settlement. The IRS survey pointed to a similar increase in the proportion of employers expecting higher settlements, but the average settlement was expected to##NewPara##increase only from .% to .%. In the Bank s survey, % of employers expected pay per head to rise by more in  than , with % expecting a lower increase than in the previous year.##NewTopic##Prices##NewPara##RPIX inflation had fallen back to .% in October, although the provisional estimate for November, which was available to the Committee at its meeting, was for some recovery. Despite the recent strength of oil prices, RPIX inflation remained subdued. The CBI Distributive Trades Survey, however, suggested diminishing downward pressure on average retail selling prices in Q.##NewPara##In October the services component of RPIX inflation had fallen to .%, its lowest level since March . But survey data on services prices were mixed. The CIPS prices charged measure stood at  in November, a little below October but well above its average level. The British Chambers of Commerce measure showed little change over the past year. The CBI Deloitte and Touche Services Survey suggested widespread price increases in consumer services since the previous survey, but with this moderating over the next three months. In the same survey, more respondents now expected prices to fall rather than rise in business and professional services.##NewPara##The GDP deflator had risen by .% over the past year. Most other measures of domestically generated inflation, such as unit labour costs (using either trend or actual productivity) and RPIX inflation excluding import prices, were at  % or less. Import price deflators remained weak, falling .% in Q and rising only .% over the past year. It was unclear how far this reflected a compression of overseas exporters  margins.##NewTopic##Tactical considerations##NewPara##The Committee noted that this month there was a very strong market expectation that the repo rate would be left unchanged, as evidenced (for instance) by the most recent Reuters poll of City economists. Any change in rates at this meeting   in either direction   would therefore be unexpected, and might be seen as a very strong signal by the market. The Committee agreed that these expectations did not act as a constraint on its actions; it merely underlined the need to provide a clear explanation for a decision to change rates. Nor could the Committee identify any other tactical factors which were relevant to its decision this month.##NewTopic##The immediate policy decision##NewPara##The Committee agreed that the world economy was probably slowing rather faster than expected, but that news on the UK economy was more mixed, with household consumption still buoyant but investment and government consumption growing more slowly. The Committee discussed the implications of these developments for its immediate policy decision.##NewPara##On one view, the repo rate should be maintained at % this month. The slowdown in the world economy, after a period of robust growth, would tend to restrain net trade, and hence UK activity. This might reduce inflationary pressures from overseas, particularly if coupled with falling oil prices. However, the overall impact would depend on how sterling s effective exchange rate reacted to the new pattern of relative growth rates between the United States, the euro area and the##NewPara##United Kingdom; sterling was already % below the path assumed in the November Inflation Report central projection. Domestically, there was little sign of a slowdown in consumption, which continued to grow at % a year. Household borrowing continued apace, supported by high levels of house prices; indeed there were signs that house price inflation might again be picking up. Survey data were mixed, but did not point to a sharp slowdown in spending, and downward pressures on retail prices might be diminishing. For some members, the consumption-related indicators suggested not only that GDP growth would remain more unbalanced than was desirable, but also that inflationary pressures might strengthen. This represented an upside risk to the November forecast, and supported a case for not ruling out the need for some upward adjustment in the repo rate, particularly as recent movements in the exchange rate and market interest rates had already resulted in some easing of monetary conditions. But with weaker world activity, RPIX inflation still below target and steady earnings growth there were still reasons to wait and see. On balance, the repo rate should therefore remain at % this month. Other members, while agreeing that the repo rate should remain unchanged, saw the risks as more evenly balanced. While consumption remained buoyant, employment growth was moderating, with unemployment marginally higher, and real income growth might be slowing; pay settlements in the new year would be an important indicator of how far tightness in the labour market would translate into higher nominal pay awards. Growth in##NewPara##investment was sluggish (though its level remained high), there was uncertainty about how fast public spending would increase, and there was a risk that inventories could fall back as the economy slowed. For some of these members the uncertainties surrounding the outlook had increased further##NewPara##since the time of the November Inflation Report. Taking all of these factors together, no change in the repo rate was needed this month.##NewPara##On a second view, the repo rate should be reduced by  basis points. The major news this month had been the sharper-than-expected slowing in world demand. Its effect would be to lower activity in the United Kingdom, and reduce RPIX inflation below what had been seen as most likely in November (which for these members was lower than the central projection in the Inflation Report because they were more optimistic about the supply-side performance of the UK economy). Taken by itself, mechanically, this month s fall in the exchange rate would tend to raise inflation, but that effect would be offset by weaker oil prices, the lower import price deflator (if sustained) and the weakness of global equities. Moreover, the downside risk to international activity was probably greater than had been allowed for in the November Inflation Report. Domestically, consumption continued to grow quite quickly, with house prices perhaps picking up. But investment growth was weaker than in the central projection, government consumption might be lower than planned and the inventory cycle was a downside risk. Leading indicators and market interest rates both suggested that the peak in growth had passed, and that growth might slow more sharply than in the central projection. The labour market could be at a turning point, although it was too soon to be sure; growth in regular pay also seemed to be moderating. Even if house price inflation remained at its recent monthly rates, and the current level of petrol prices was sustained, the annual rate of RPIX inflation would tend to fall, other things being equal, as earlier high increases dropped out of the calculation. This effect would tend to be amplified by the likely fall in oil prices and also by the possible decline in fuel duties that would result if the measures set out for consultation in the##NewPara##Pre-Budget Report were enacted. RPIX inflation had now been below  % for more than##NewPara## months; without an early policy response it might well continue to be so for the next two years. While current monetary conditions had loosened slightly over the month as a result of the fall in the exchange rate and in market interest rates, a Dynamic Monetary Conditions Index, which took account of the effects of lags, continued to tighten slightly. At present, on most estimates for neutral interest rate levels, monetary policy was slightly contractionary; this no longer appeared appropriate. To cut rates would be a pre-emptive move which would help sustain business and consumer confidence in the event of spillover effects from a deteriorating international environment. A reduction in the repo rate to .% was therefore warranted this month.##NewPara##The Governor invited members to vote on the proposition that the Bank s repo rate be maintained at .%. Seven members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King,##NewPara##David Clementi, Christopher Allsopp, Charles Bean, Stephen Nickell and Ian Plenderleith) voted for the proposition. DeAnne Julius and Sushil Wadhwani voted against, preferring a reduction in the repo rate of  basis points.
