The prospects for global activity and prices##NewPara##Stronger-than-expected data on employment and GDP in the third quarter had suggested that the United States economy continued to be surprisingly robust. However, expectations were that US growth would be slower in the coming year. The Japanese economy had weakened further, with GDP falling in Q by .%.##NewPara##In Europe, Japan and the United States, there seemed to be a continuing downward trend in business confidence   despite the strong GDP figures in Germany and the United States. This might mean that businesses were beginning to feel the trade effects arising from the crises in Asia and other emerging markets. The declines in business confidence might also reflect a squeeze on profits as weakening world demand had increased competition and contributed to downward pressure on world prices. Since the previous meeting, the OECD, the World Trade Organisation and the World Bank had revised down their forecasts for world trade in . Although domestic demand in the industrialised countries remained relatively robust so far, declines in business confidence were consistent with a prospective slowdown in world trade. It was clear that the expected changes in world trade implied larger current account deficits in the industrialised countries, but it was not clear how these would be spread across countries.##NewPara##Oil and other commodity prices had continued to fall. The one-month price of Brent crude had fallen below $ per barrel at the time of the meeting. Although caused partly by a fall in world demand, the fall in oil prices should act as a positive supply shock to industrialised countries and would therefore be supportive of future activity. However, the effects could be de-stabilising in the short run: the terms-of-trade effect would be a significant negative shock for those countries heavily dependent on oil revenues.##NewPara##Although the world financial situation had improved slightly, and backward-looking data for the real economies of the United States and Europe had remained firm, the Committee concluded that the forward indicators of world activity and prices were probably softer than at the time the November Inflation Report projections were finalised.##NewTopic##Consumption##NewPara##Consumption growth in Q had been below that assumed in the November Inflation Report central projection and retail sales growth suggested that the weakening of consumption growth had thus far continued into Q. Looking back at the out-turns for consumption in , growth had been systematically lower than the Committee had expected earlier in the year. While the forecast errors were within the usual statistical error bands on models of consumption behaviour, it was important to try to understand the possible causes of the apparent slowdown in consumption.##NewPara##The out-turns for consumption growth did not appear to be entirely consistent with its fundamental determinants: labour income had continued growing strongly and total net wealth had remained high throughout .##NewPara##Leaving aside the possibility of inaccurate data, the Committee discussed a number of potential reasons for the slower-than-expected consumption growth. One was that the effects on consumers expenditure of windfall payouts to consumers in , following the conversion of a number of financial institutions from mutual to PLC status, might have been more bunched than expected. The Bank s analysis of windfall spending had suggested that some consumers would bring forward their purchases of consumer durables. If this had distorted the natural replacement cycle, the  data might be reflecting a negative effect as fewer replacement items were purchased.##NewPara##A second possible explanation was that consumers were worried about the outlook for employment and hence had been saving more than had been assumed in the Bank forecast.##NewPara##A third possible explanation was that consumers had not reacted to the measured increases in wealth in the same way as the average of their past responses. The reaction to an increase in asset prices, in particular equity prices, might also depend on what had caused the price rise. Consumers might react differently to changes in the discount rate (the real interest rate appeared to have fallen) than to changes in expected post-tax corporate earnings. And changes in discount rates might themselves be a reflection of changing household preferences (because of demographics for example) as between present and future consumption. Consumers might also have perceived the rise in equity prices to be temporary.##NewPara##It was also possible that the effects of the fiscal tightening might not have been captured fully in earlier forecasts of consumption. The changes in the last two Budgets had had much of their initial impact on the corporate sector, and hence on the personal sector via its ownership of the corporate sector. It was difficult to be sure that the tax changes had been properly captured in the relationship between consumption and measured wealth and income.##NewPara##A fifth possible explanation was that weak consumer confidence could lead to a self-fulfilling outcome of weaker demand, which would have the effect of justifying and adding to the initial pessimism.##NewPara##A sixth possible explanation was that consumers might now be more price sensitive and so were waiting for retailers to cut prices further before spending. For example, the Bank had received anecdotal evidence from the regional Agents that discount clothing stores had been expanding their market share at the expense of traditional established department and chain stores.##NewPara##The Committee considered these possible explanations but concluded that none of the six explanations proposed was sufficient on its own.##NewPara##One of the counterparts to weaker consumption growth had been a bigger-than-expected build-up in inventories. In the third quarter there had been a marked accumulation of manufacturing inventories of finished goods, while retail inventories had been growing steadily over the year. The November Inflation Report had already built in a significant negative effect on GDP growth from an inventory cycle during  but the latest data perhaps increased the downside risk to that projection.##NewTopic##Other activity indicators##NewPara##GDP growth in Q had been revised down from .% to .%. This was the first quarter of growth clearly below trend since  Q. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research s monthly estimate of GDP was indicating zero growth in the three months to the end of November. It was, therefore, now possible that the fourth quarter could be even weaker than the Inflation Report central projection of a small positive growth rate.##NewPara##The survey data had continued to deteriorate. The three surveys from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) for manufacturing, services and construction were now all indicating falls in output. The Committee noted that the trend in activity growth indicated by the surveys remained downward. Although it was not yet clear whether Q growth would be weaker than expected, the downside risks had increased since the Committee s previous meeting.##NewPara##The Committee considered the possibility that the BRC s  like-for-like  adjustment was distorting downwards its measure of underlying retail sales growth and that the unadjusted measure (which had been closer to ONS data in recent months) was a better guide.##NewPara##The trade data in Q had shown a significant widening of the trade deficit reflecting strong import growth, possibly reflecting the strong investment and inventories numbers. The Committee was reluctant to read too much into quarterly swings in the external accounts. The negative effects of##NewPara##weaker world demand and the appreciation of sterling had been clear in the trend for exports for some time.##NewTopic##Labour market##NewPara##The labour market quantities data had continued to indicate growth in employment, but at a somewhat slower rate. Unemployment data were beginning to show small increases. Business surveys, such as the CIPS employment survey and the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services survey, both for November, generally showed a weaker employment picture.##NewPara##Data on pay settlements were relatively stable at around   %. Wage drift was perhaps more likely to be falling than rising, given the slowdown in output growth. So, although the labour market remained tight, it was possible that it was no longer tightening and some indicators suggested that it might even be beginning to ease. On the other hand the Reed Personnel Services skill shortages index showed a further rise for Q and official figures on the stock of unfilled vacancies were at a record high. National press advertising had also remained buoyant.##NewPara##The Agents had reported considerable concern amongst contacts about the effects of the Working Time Directive, mainly about the level of bureaucracy and the minimum holiday entitlement. It was not clear how big an effect the directive would have on costs or prices.##NewTopic##Prices and inflation expectations##NewPara##Inflation forecasts, surveys of financial market professionals and derived inflation expectations from index-linked gilts all seemed to be broadly consistent with the   % RPIX inflation target. It was possible that surveys of the inflation expectations of the general public, which remained above   %, would decline towards the target as RPI inflation fell relative to RPIX inflation. This reduction in inflation expectations might diminish some of the upside risks to inflation.##NewTopic##Monetary conditions##NewPara##Aggregate M growth had continued at annual rates of over % and the Committee discussed whether it was possible to have low output growth when real broad money was growing so strongly. Historical evidence suggested that real M growth had not always weakened before a slowdown in activity growth, so the Committee could not infer much about the imminent risks to activity.##NewPara##Furthermore, stripping out the contribution of Other Financial Corporations (OFCs) to broad money growth gave somewhat lower annual growth rates of around %.##NewPara##Other monetary and financial indicators had remained firm: notes and coin were growing at over % per annum, equity prices had remained at high levels, and house price inflation was easing, but##NewPara##remained at .% and .% per annum on the Halifax and Nationwide measures. If activity growth continued to slow, one might expect a simultaneous slowdown in broad money growth, possibly alongside a fall in asset prices.##NewPara##On the credit side, there had been few signs of distress borrowing in the corporate sector, and the growth of lending to the personal sector had remained strong   particularly for unsecured credit.##NewTopic##The level of interest rates##NewPara##The Committee discussed whether it was helpful to think about the appropriate level of nominal interest rates by reference to the concept of a  neutral  level, which provides neither stimulus nor restraint to the economy. A broad estimate of the neutral short nominal interest rate could in principle be estimated by combining short-run inflation expectations with an estimate of an average short real interest rate.##NewPara##Inflation expectations appeared to have fallen and it was no longer implausible to think of them as being broadly consistent with the   % target for RPIX inflation. Some members of the Committee concluded that the appropriate assumption might be a little higher than this given that domestically generated inflation was probably well above   % and was likely to be more persistent than imported inflation.##NewPara##There was more difficulty in estimating the neutral short real rate. Alternative approaches gave different estimates. For example, one could use as a guide historical averages of ex post real returns on nominal government bonds, cross-country comparisons, or long-term forward real rates derived from index-linked gilts. These gave a range perhaps as wide as %-%. On this basis, estimates of the neutral nominal rate fell in a range of around   % to around   %.##NewPara##While some members of the Committee found the concept of the neutral rate useful in deciding on interest rate policy, other members found the uncertainty surrounding its level so large that the concept was of little use as a practical guide to policy.##NewTopic##Other considerations bearing on the decision this month##NewPara##The Committee noted that much of its concern related to the prospects for consumption growth and confidence. Since a large share of consumer spending happened around the Christmas period it was possible that a move this month would have a larger effect in supporting activity in the short run than a delayed move, without damaging the prospects for inflation over the medium term.##NewPara##The Committee also discussed the new evidence since the Inflation Report was published. It was noted that, with the risks on the downside, the mean of the RPIX projection  years ahead published##NewPara##in November had already been below   %. Since then the global situation (including commodity prices) appeared to have weakened further and domestic indicators suggested that the balance of risks to UK activity was even further on the downside, so that the expected inflation rate two years ahead had fallen since the November Inflation Report.##NewPara##As usual, the Committee considered whether a change in rates would disturb financial markets. A number of economic commentators were predicting that the Committee would make a cut of .% and many thought a larger cut was warranted. An immediate cut of .% was within the range of outcomes the market had factored in by the start of the meeting so it was unlikely that a similar size cut would have an unsettling effect. It was difficult to judge the market consequences of a different decision. The reaction of sterling might depend on whether markets interpreted the change in terms of stronger or weaker prospects for activity growth.##NewTopic##The immediate policy decision##NewPara##The Committee concluded that the prospects for global activity and prices had weakened over the month. Business confidence had been declining across the major economies and commodity prices, particularly oil, had fallen further. The global financial situation was probably no worse, but UK trade data showed that the effects of slower world demand were beginning to come through on top of the impact of sterling s appreciation. The United States and the euro area had both cut rates since the previous MPC meeting. The main domestic news seemed to be in respect of consumption growth, which had been slower than expected during  as a whole and, on the basis of retail sales growth, was still slowing. There were a number of possible explanations for this, but none was sufficient on its own.##NewPara##Other indicators of domestic activity also showed a continuing softening. The CIPS surveys were now indicating negative growth in all the main sectors of the economy. In contrast, the available data suggested that the labour market remained tight although there were now some signals that the situation might be beginning to ease. Money growth remained strong and asset prices remained firm.##NewPara##Taking all the news together, the Committee concluded that there was a clear case for a further cut in rates this month. The question was how much.##NewPara##An argument for a .% cut was identified. The data might be sufficient to justify a cut of .% but the uncertainty and the remaining upside risks arguably made it slightly preferable to cut by .% this month with another .% to come in January if the analysis was supported by the data.##NewPara##The widely held view was that an immediate cut in rates of .% was justified in terms of incremental news on the month. In particular the downside risks to both activity and prices appeared##NewPara##to have increased with the unexpected weakness in consumption being a major concern.##NewPara##Some Committee members found it helpful this month to consider where we were in relation to an estimate of the neutral level of nominal rates. Although subject to a wide range of uncertainty, the neutral rate was likely to be somewhat below the current level of .%. Therefore a cut of .% this month would be consistent with the news and a step towards neutral.##NewPara##Among those who questioned the practical use of the concept of the neutral rate it was recalled that similar arguments about the level of rates had been used in the mid-eighties to justify lowering rates to levels which subsequently turned out to be too expansionary. On these grounds one should be cautious about the use of such calculations to justify changes in policy.##NewPara##On another view, a neutral rate would probably be significantly lower than the current rate of .% and the conjuncture indicated that we should be below neutral rather than above. However, a sequence of cuts would have a greater impact than a single cut of substantially more than .%, which would be seen as an over reaction and might, on this view, be an unnecessary shock to financial markets. On these grounds an immediate cut of only .% was appropriate.##NewPara##A further view was that there had been a case for cutting by more than .% the previous month and, with the news this month, this suggested that a larger reduction than .% was now appropriate. Short rates were too high, both in comparison with long rates and compared with short rates in other countries. On this view, there was no good reason for cutting rates in steps. The Committee was learning all the time about the response of the economy to shocks and it appeared that the real side of the economy had responded faster to events than the Committee had expected.##NewPara##On this view there should be an immediate cut of more than .%.##NewPara##The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank s repo rate be cut by  basis points to .%. Eight members of the Committee (the Governor,##NewPara##Mervyn King, David Clementi, Alan Budd, Charles Goodhart, DeAnne Julius, Ian Plenderleith and John Vickers) voted for the proposition. Willem Buiter voted against, preferring a cut of  basis points.
