The world economy##NewPara##The Committee considered developments in the world economy since the publication of the November Inflation Report. Outside Japan activity in Asia had strengthened perceptibly, as it had in the euro area, which was the single most important market for UK exporters. According to the most recent estimates, euro-area GDP had increased by % on a quarterly basis in  Q, with growth in the previous quarter revised up to .%. The recovery now seemed to be spreading to Italy and Germany, in the latter case confirming the more buoyant picture shown by business confidence indicators and orders data, both of which had risen further in recent months.##NewPara##GDP growth in the US in  Q had been very strong, at .% on a quarterly basis. More recently, in December US consumer confidence, as measured by the Conference Board, had risen to its highest level for over  years, and non-farm payrolls had continued to increase rapidly. While labour market data suggested considerable pressure on resources, this was not reflected in the capacity utilisation measures themselves.##NewPara##Although both oil and non-oil commodity prices were rather stronger than had been expected in November, there had as yet been limited pass-through into prices further along the supply chain, particularly at the retail level. This might reflect lags, or the persistence of spare capacity in the world economy, putting downward pressure on margins. Alternatively, it might be related to stronger productivity growth, especially in the US. Following the extensive revisions to past data, most estimates of trend GDP growth in the US had been revised up. Equity prices might also suggest that expectations of sustainable growth were stronger than previously, but it was too soon to be sure whether such a rerating was valid, or whether stock markets had overshot on the upside.##NewPara##To the extent that the rise in the price of technology stocks reflected expectations of rapid improvements in productivity, the boost to demand associated with the rise in share prices might be##NewPara##greater, at least in the short run, than the supply-side effects from higher future productivity. The extent to which the rise in the price of technology stocks may have affected consumption was unclear, although increases in wealth more generally helped to explain the low US personal savings ratio.##NewPara##The Committee discussed the implications of these developments for the US balance of payments. If trend growth in the US were indeed higher, the present current account deficit might narrow once the improvements on the supply side, which were perhaps already being anticipated by higher demand, began to feed through. If these improvements did not materialise, portfolio investment and capital flows linked to mergers and acquisition business could rapidly reverse, especially if stock markets fell back, with a risk that the dollar might decline sharply.##NewPara##The Committee concluded that while the risks from a fall in stock markets and from current account imbalances remained significant, these had been present for some time and had not changed in degree over the past month or so. These risks aside, the outlook for world economic growth was now stronger than it had been, and the recovery in Continental Europe, which seemed to have become more firmly based over the past month, was of particular importance to the UK through its prospective effects on net trade.##NewTopic##Money and asset prices##NewPara##Narrow money had surged in December, with notes and coin increasing by more than  % in the month, and with the twelve-month growth rate (of  %) at its highest for twenty years. This appeared to reflect end-year or end-millennium effects, including greater-than-normal stocking of ATMs and higher cash holdings by the public. A sharp reversal in the level of notes and coin now seemed to be under way in January. The Committee agreed that these movements were unlikely to have wider implications for the rest of the economy; both these and the pattern of retail sales around the turn of the year might be examples of seasonal or millennium  fog  which obscured the underlying position.  By contrast, once allowance was made for the weak growth of deposits by Other Financial Corporations (OFCs), the underlying growth in broad money was rather stable, at around %.##NewPara##M lending to households had again been strong, with the twelve-month growth rate the highest for eight years, and the Bank s estimate for mortgage equity withdrawal had been revised up##NewPara##to  . billion in  Q.  Borrowing for consumption    a measure which combined estimates of mortgage equity withdrawal and unsecured lending   was at nearly % of disposable income in Q, its highest level since late .##NewPara##The housing market remained buoyant, with prices rising some  % over the last year on both the Halifax and Nationwide measures, and with house price strength now more widely spread across the UK than before, although significant regional differences remained. Measures of turnover and housing activity showed a less clear trend, however, and a survey of house prices by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) for December recorded a rather lower figure for the balance of estate agents reporting a rise in house prices.##NewPara##Two-year interest rates had risen by around  basis points since the December meeting. The rise in interest rates had not been offset by a rise in inflation expectations. Other things being equal, the rise in real interest rates along the yield curve would tend to dampen demand, including via its effect on new fixed-rate mortgages. So monetary conditions in the UK had clearly tightened over the past month. This might in part reflect the stronger prospects for world economic activity.##NewPara##In addition, the effective exchange rate index had risen by around  % over the month. This would exacerbate the impact on net trade of the earlier appreciation, although it would be offset at least in part by the pick-up in world demand. Meanwhile equity prices in the UK had been rather volatile, rising during December and then falling back, but on balance were little changed over the month, and remained well above the central projection in the November Inflation Report.##NewTopic##Demand and output##NewPara##The latest National Accounts data included revisions for the period from  Q. While estimates of the level of GDP in  Q were little changed, growth in  Q had been revised down, with more of a recovery in the following two quarters. GDP at constant market prices was now estimated to have grown by .% in  Q (as against the previous figure of .%) but the year-on-year figure had been revised up to .% (from .%).##NewPara##Household consumption was still estimated to have risen by .% in  Q, but the level of consumption was now .% lower than previously estimated, in part reflecting a downward revision to expenditure on cars earlier in  following the changes in the seasonal pattern for vehicle##NewPara##registration. Business investment had fallen in Q, and growth in investment as a whole in the quarter was barely positive. Within the total, manufacturing investment continued to fall, perhaps reflecting past pressure on margins, and there had also been a slight decline in investment by the services sector, after previous estimates had been revised up to show more rapid growth over the previous year. It was possible that some of the weakness in business investment reflected a pause in IT spending ahead of the new millennium. Government investment had increased sharply in Q, although it remained well below planned levels. The level of government consumption expenditure had been revised down, though growth in Q was stronger than previous estimates.##NewPara##Final domestic demand in Q was now estimated to be .% above its level of a year earlier, compared with .% in Q, a figure which had itself been revised down from .% in the previous estimate. Moreover, it seemed unlikely on present indications that year-on-year growth would pick up significantly from the %- % range either in  Q or the present quarter. While such growth was likely to be too high to be sustainable in the long run, it was significantly lower than the %- % rates reported earlier in , before the latest revisions had been made. The quarterly growth rate of final domestic demand had slowed more sharply, from .% in  Q to .% in Q, which if it persisted would no longer be above its sustainable rate. However, surveys and other evidence suggested that it could pick-up in Q.##NewPara##While final domestic demand growth had fallen back, net external demand had been stronger in Q and Q, making a positive contribution to GDP growth on a quarterly basis (though this might not continue into Q). As a result growth in GDP on a year ago was only . percentage points lower in Q than growth in domestic demand, compared with a gap of . percentage points in##NewPara## Q. To that extent the recovery was now better balanced. The stronger performance of net exports might, if sustained, tend to put pressure on resources unless domestic demand growth continued to moderate. However, there was spare capacity in many export and manufacturing sectors following their recent downturns.##NewPara##There was also some evidence of better balance in the economy from the output data, with both manufacturing and industrial output up .% over the previous quarter in Q, while the services sector had grown by .%. Such a recovery in industrial output was consistent with the upturn in external demand from Continental Europe; but the slowdown in services, which was in part due to lower growth in the financial and business services category, was less easy to explain, unless it reflected a pause ahead of the new millennium.##NewPara##Growth in retail sales volumes (which excluded spending on vehicles) continued to slow on a three month on three month basis, while still running at around % at an annual rate. As always, it was difficult to gauge the underlying pattern of sales over the Christmas and New Year period, and it would be sensible to look at data for December and January together when these became available. This was even truer this year, given the uncertainties over the impact of the millennium date change. However, most of the determinants and indicators of consumption (such as real labour incomes, financial and non-financial wealth and household borrowing, as well as consumer confidence) appeared either to be strengthening or to have remained strong, suggesting that consumer spending might continue to grow relatively rapidly in the near future; this was in line with survey data on retail sales for December. But car sales seemed to be weak, with some consumers apparently delaying purchases in the hope that prices might fall sharply in the near future.##NewTopic##The labour market##NewPara##Whole-economy headline earnings had risen by .% in the year to October, with private sector earnings up by .%. The headline figures represented a three-month average; taking the data for October alone, whole-economy earnings were up .% on a year earlier, even though October was not a month in which bonus payments were typically large. There could be further upwards pressure on the Average Earnings Index in the next few months, if bonus payments were unusually high, for instance for millennium-related reasons. In any case, the figures for October suggested an upward revision to the profile for earnings contained in the central projection in the November Inflation Report.##NewPara##There was some evidence of a recovery in labour productivity in the most recent data, at least part of which was expected for cyclical reasons. The Inflation Report had built in a recovery in productivity growth, and the increase seen in Q provided some support for that assumption. But unless productivity continued to improve, or pressure on margins intensified further, or the exchange rate continued to strengthen, stronger nominal earnings growth would lead to higher inflation in the medium term. Other indicators of wage pressure were more mixed, and as usual for the time of year there was little new information on settlements.##NewPara##Employment had continued to increase, but at a rather slower pace than in the previous two months, with Labour Force Survey (LFS) employment up .% in the three months to October compared with the previous three months, and other survey data also pointing to slower growth.##NewPara##Unemployment had fallen again, but on the LFS measure had remained at .%, with some of the rise in employment reflecting, in an accounting sense, a reduction in the numbers of those previously inactive who wanted a job. The Bank s regional Agents continued to report that skills shortages##NewPara##had   at least in some areas   increased further but evidence the previous month from both the CBI Industrial Trends survey and the recently introduced CBI/Deloitte Services survey had suggested that skilled labour shortages were still below historical averages. Figures for turnover in the labour market, constructed from P job separation data, suggested that job creation might be increasing in gross terms. A weighted index of employment in manufacturing, services and construction based on data from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) suggested continuing, but rather modest, growth in employment in December, in line with other surveys, such as that by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation.##NewPara##The Committee agreed that the labour market remained tight, and that in underlying terms earnings growth was becoming uncomfortably high, particularly if productivity growth did not pick up further. This strength might be exaggerated by erratic factors (such as unusually large one-off bonuses) in the coming months, part of which might be millennium-related.##NewTopic##Prices and costs##NewPara##Despite the path of labour costs and oil and other commodity prices, retail price inflation remained subdued, with RPIX growing at .% in November, below the  % target for the eighth month in succession. The strength of the exchange rate was one possible cause; another was the impact of competition (including via the Internet) which might act to restrain prices. Such  e-tailing  was now being talked about as increasingly important not just for goods such as books and CDs, but was also seen as likely to become more important for other sectors such as electrical equipment and cars. By shortening the supply chain e-tailing might drive down costs for consumers who bypassed the distributors, and depress margins for the more traditional retailers and other intermediaries. An overall reduction in distribution costs through greater business-to-business e-commerce might show up as higher productivity in coming years.  Alternatively, the effects of such competition might prove either to be transitory or merely to redistribute profits between retailers; and reports of squeezes on margins at retailers might suggest that some of these adjustments had already occurred.##NewPara##The Committee noted that the inflation expectations of the general public, as measured in the latest Barclays BASIX survey, had increased in Q, the first increase since  Q. However, since##NewPara##the inflation measure was not specified, this might be no more than a reflection of the##NewPara##widely-expected rise in the RPI measure of inflation, which included mortgage interest payments.##NewTopic##Other considerations##NewPara##The Committee discussed whether the change of millennium had given rise to problems of data interpretation, over and above the normal difficulties in identifying underlying developments over the Christmas and New Year period.##NewPara##At its previous meeting, the Committee had reaffirmed that there was no reason for the YK period to constrain monetary policy setting in the UK, and had also noted that it was unclear whether any  fog  around the year-end would be much thicker than usual. So far any YK uncertainties had indeed appeared to be rather limited. While some figures had clearly been affected, such as the narrow money data, adjustments could be made to take account of the distortions. The pattern of retail sales was not yet clear, but this was typical at this time of year. The prospect of the new millennium might have had some impact on investment, for instance in IT, though this remained unclear. That said, many of the backward-looking data were still for periods before the turn of the year, so further distortions in the data might perhaps be expected.##NewPara##The Committee also noted that during the next month it would carry out a new quarterly forecast for the February Inflation Report. This would allow it to analyse some of the puzzles in the data in more detail, such as the continuing coexistence of relatively subdued retail price inflation, above-trend growth in demand, and a pick-up in earnings growth and commodity prices. To the extent that uncertainties surrounding some of these issues might soon diminish in a way which informed the policy decision, there was a case for waiting until this had been done. But to the extent that the news since the previous meeting warranted an increase in rates, there was no reason for a delay, and some members of the Committee had felt that a rise in rates had been needed already in December.##NewTopic##The immediate policy decision##NewPara##The external environment for the UK had strengthened over the past month, as had most of the determinants of domestic demand, including wealth, labour income and household borrowing.##NewPara##At the same time, final domestic demand in Q had slowed, and inflation remained below the  % target. The Committee discussed the implications of these developments.##NewPara##On one view, the repo rate should be increased by  basis points this month. Various considerations were advanced to support this view, with different members of the Committee placing differing weights on the factors identified.##NewPara##For some, the choice this month was between raising rates by  or  basis points, but on balance there was no need to move by more than  basis points now. Since the previous meeting, the change in the economy had not been dramatic. The strengthening in the outlook for the world economy, especially in the euro area, had produced better balanced growth in the UK, but meant that domestic demand growth would need to slow further from its present %- % annual rate if it were to be sustainable. In addition, a more generalised pick-up in world activity might place further upward pressure on commodity prices. While the very fast growth in narrow money in December seemed largely to reflect transitory factors, the credit figures were more of a concern. The sharp pick-up in borrowing for consumption, from % of personal disposable income at the start of  to##NewPara##almost % in Q, coupled with house prices and equity prices well above the central projection in the November Inflation Report, would tend to support robust consumption growth. This would put upward pressure on inflation in the future, despite a further rise in sterling and a welcome recovery in estimates of productivity growth to rather closer to the long-run trend. With annual retail sales growth remaining around %, further pressure would be placed on resources in the short term if investment recovered following the millennium change. In addition there was now some evidence that the tightening in the labour market was beginning to feed through into earnings. Average earnings in the private sector were growing at more than % on a year earlier, implying earnings growth well above the central projection in the November Inflation Report. Nevertheless, with inflation at present subdued, the costs of waiting a further month before deciding whether a further change in rates was going to be needed were small; the February Inflation Report provided an opportunity to carry out more analysis. Given the uncertainties, a tightening of policy this month by  basis points was the appropriate response.##NewPara##Other members of the Committee agreed that an increase of  basis points was needed this month, but felt the outlook, particularly for inflation, was rather more benign. The pace of domestic demand appeared to be slowing and the recent news on GDP growth was in the surprisingly strong export figures, where the economy still had considerable room for growth. Inflation was still##NewPara##expected to remain below the  % target for some time.  Sterling had strengthened further, and some thought that it might rise even more, which would help to restrain prices. So too might structural changes in the economy over a number of years, perhaps reflecting stronger global competition and greater price sensitivity of consumers as a result of the enhanced price transparency brought about by Internet use. It was plausible that the growth of business-to-business e-commerce would lead to a significant reduction in costs.  Average earnings might rise further in coming months, but this would partly reflect one-off factors such as bonuses; it would be important also to look at settlements data, as well as further micro-economic evidence on margins and productivity. It was also suggested that if the neutral level of real interest rates were around %, as some historical work suggested, and inflation expectations were firmly anchored at  %, a neutral nominal rate would be around  %. Given the strengthening of the world economy and many of the determinants of UK consumption it was appropriate for monetary policy to be tighter than neutral at present, but not by a great deal, especially given the strength of sterling, and this justified a  basis point increase in the repo rate.##NewPara##On another view, an increase of  basis points was needed now. The recovery in the world economy and the remarkable strength in the principal determinants and indicators of consumption   such as real wages, secured and unsecured credit to households, wealth, and consumer confidence   suggested that in the absence of a tightening in monetary policy GDP would continue to grow above trend. Against this background the slowdown in final domestic demand in Q might well prove to be erratic. Given the strength of nominal earnings growth, it seemed likely that, in the absence of a stronger exchange rate, significant further improvements in productivity growth, or an intensification of the squeeze on margins, greater upward pressure would be placed on inflation in the medium term, even though at present RPIX was rising at less than  %. An increase in rates of  basis points had been needed last month, and given developments since then more was needed now. The arguments for waiting a further month, for more data and the analysis underlying the February Inflation Report, were insufficient reason for delay: an increase of  basis points in the repo rate was required this month.##NewPara##The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank s repo rate be increased by  basis points to .%. Eight members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King, David Clementi, Charles Goodhart, DeAnne Julius, Ian Plenderleith, John Vickers and Sushil Wadhwani) voted for the proposition. Willem Buiter voted against, preferring an increase of  basis points.
