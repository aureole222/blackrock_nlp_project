The world economy##NewPara##While world output growth had been faster than expected in the first half of the year, it now seemed to be slowing. In the United States, there had been a sharp fall in recorded growth between Q and Q. Investment growth had slowed, including in the information, communications and technology (ICT) sector. This might signal a wider re-evaluation of the prospects for ICT-based business and, if it persisted, might affect the growth of productive capacity. Looking ahead, a number of factors would prospectively restrain growth: the stronger dollar, tighter credit conditions, softer equity prices and the rise in oil prices, as well as the earlier increases in official interest rates. A sustained slowdown therefore looked more likely now than when the Committee had produced its August projections. The implications for US inflation were, however, less clear. On the one hand, slowing growth and moderating oil prices would help to restrain inflation; core CPI inflation had fallen slightly to .% in September. On the other hand, tight conditions in labour and product markets were evidenced by an acceleration over recent months in earnings and producer prices; and it was possible that, even with somewhat slower growth, the level of aggregate demand would be above the economy s productive capacity. Some members thought that the degree to which equity prices fell in anticipation of lower corporate profits would be a key determinant of the relative supply-demand balance and inflation.##NewPara##In the euro area, the annual rate of output growth had been close to % in Q. The Committee noted the misperception that the area s economic performance had been weak: the annual rate of growth had, in fact, been faster than in the United Kingdom in every quarter since the monetary union was established. There were, though, now signs of a slowdown. For example, recent data on orders, retail sales and consumer confidence had been weak. Partly on account of the euro s continued depreciation, the rise in oil prices had had a larger impact on inflation in the euro area than elsewhere##NewPara##in the industrialised world. The HICP measure of inflation had risen from .% in August to .% in September, materially above the ECB s % ceiling, although core inflation was .%.##NewPara##In Japan, recovery had been supported by business investment, associated with improving corporate profitability, but the outlook remained subdued on account of persistently weak consumer confidence and continuing financial sector fragility. The Bank of Japan had recently said that the risks were mainly on the downside.##NewPara##The Committee judged that, more generally, the balance of risks to world economic growth was clearly on the downside. Much would depend on developments in the United States; it was noted that the Committee s central projection for US growth in  was now above the consensus forecast. Slowing growth was welcome, as was October s correction in equity prices, which had been associated with revised expectations of corporate earnings growth, especially in the  new economy  sectors, and with an analysis of the effects of increased leverage. It was not yet clear, however, how much of the economy was being affected by tighter credit conditions. It was possible that there would be exaggerated revisions to perceptions of the underlying supply-side performance of the economy, affecting asset prices and the dollar, if productivity growth fell in the short term as the economy slowed. While the course of the economy so far seemed consistent with a  soft landing , it was noted that it could be difficult to distinguish from the beginnings of a  hard landing .##NewPara##There was also somewhat greater fragility amongst emerging market economies. Credit spreads had been rising, especially in Argentina; Korea was in the midst of a difficult restructuring of the corporate sector; and Asian equity markets had fallen by about % since the beginning of the year notwithstanding the recovery in industrial production. Prospective emerging market economy growth was also vulnerable to slowdown in the US economy.##NewTopic##Money, credit and asset prices##NewPara##In the United Kingdom, annual M and M lending growth had remained strong, even after excluding deposit and loan transactions with Other Financial Corporations.##NewPara##Although growth in household sector borrowing had slowed slightly between Q and Q, it was still about %, and so around the fastest rate since , accounted for largely by the strength of##NewPara##mortgage borrowing over the past year. Part of this might be accounted for by mortgage equity withdrawal, and it would need to be watched. House prices had risen by around % during , and intensified competitive conditions in the retail banking industry   leading to lower spreads and some new, flexible loan products   were making it easier for households to unlock such increases in wealth. That might help to explain stronger-than-expected consumer spending over recent quarters. It might also lend support to expectations that consumption growth would slow, given that house price inflation was now more subdued.##NewPara##The interpretation of developments in the corporate sector s financial position was less clear. Both deposits and borrowing had been growing rapidly since the summer. While the telecom sector had accounted for some of the increased borrowing, this was not the whole story. The non-financial corporate sector was running a deficit of around  % of GDP. While considerably below the levels seen in the s, this was a bigger deficit than during most of the s. Corporate sector liquidity##NewPara##nevertheless seemed strong: the stock of corporate deposits was near historical highs as a proportion of the stock of borrowing. It seemed that, in aggregate, firms were borrowing in part to acquire financial assets. It was possible that mergers and acquisitions were having a material effect on the data, but further analysis was needed. In the meantime, it was hard to draw any conclusions about the implications for demand.##NewPara##Sterling s effective exchange rate index had fallen % over the month, falling against the dollar and rising against the euro. It had been volatile during the month, having spiked up to about  before easing back to around  by the time of the meeting. The Committee thought that the most recent levels were more relevant to an assessment of the inflation outlook, and so to policy, than the -day moving average (.) which, by convention, was typically used as the starting point in its##NewPara##Inflation Report projections. It therefore agreed that the November projections should use the five-day average (.) as the starting point, which was about one and a half per cent above the level implied in August s central projection. It would be important to explain in the Inflation Report the reason for the change in presentation in this instance and to show the difference it made to the projections.##NewPara##Most members of the Committee continued to regard the balance of risks to sterling as lying on the downside. In the short term, there was added uncertainty about exchange rates generally given the delayed conclusion of the US Presidential election.##NewTopic##Demand and output##NewPara##On preliminary ONS data, output growth had slowed from .% in Q to .% in Q. Forward-looking business surveys had generally weakened slightly.##NewPara##The Committee s inflation and output projections assumed that private sector demand growth would slow considerably. This would be necessary if inflation were to remain in line with the  % target, given the planned increase in government spending. The outlook for consumption, accounting for roughly % of private sector spending, was therefore especially important. The backward- looking data and forward-looking indicators presented different pictures. On the one hand, retail sales had risen by .% in September and by .% between Q and Q, faster than for a while; and the Bank s regional Agents reported contacts as seeing steady sales growth. On the other hand, equity prices and house prices had been broadly flat; survey measures of consumer confidence were weaker than in the summer, although they had recovered from the petrol crisis-induced fall in September; and the CBI Distributive Trades and British Retail Consortium surveys were weaker. In addition, the Committee projected that unemployment would soon stop falling, which could affect confidence. In the near term, it was possible that the transport problems and floods, although localised, would affect aggregate household spending for a while and make the monthly data hard to interpret.##NewPara##Investment growth   particularly in the services sector   had been slower than for some time in Q and Q. Although the Q data were not yet available, some members thought that the outlook had become weaker over the past month or so. On the one hand, equity prices had not risen much in recent months, the market for initial public offerings was currently more difficult, and credit conditions had recently tightened somewhat as measured by the spread of corporate bond yields over swap rates (although by less than in the United States). On the other hand, corporate sector borrowing remained strong, as did surveys of service sector investment intentions. On balance, the Committee decided to incorporate into its central projections a slightly lower profile for investment growth than in August.##NewPara##The Treasury representative updated the Committee on the Government s Pre-Budget Report, which was published during the Committee s Wednesday afternoon session. Nothing material to the Committee s projections had changed since the Committee had been briefed the previous week. Higher planned spending was financed by higher-than-previously-expected revenue, and there was little net impact on the Committee s medium-term projections. Recent tax revenue outturns seemed to##NewPara##imply a higher effective tax rate than in the past. The changes to fuel duties would temporarily reduce inflation, other things being equal, in the short term. The various measures on which the Government was consulting were, by convention, not taken into account in the projections because they were not yet definite. It was noted that if implemented they too would temporarily reduce measured inflation slightly, although there would be some partly offsetting demand effects to take into account.##NewTopic##Labour market conditions##NewPara##Employment had risen by around , in the three months to August compared with the previous three months; part-time work rose slightly more than this, and full-time employment fell slightly. Average hours worked had also risen. Unemployment had fallen by around ,, largely accounted for by a fall in the short-term unemployed. Vacancies had risen, and the British Chambers of Commerce, Recruitment and Employment Confederation and CBI surveys were all suggesting increasing recruitment difficulties and skill shortages, as were contacts of the Bank s regional Agents.##NewPara##The continued tightening in the labour market had not, though, been reflected in headline (three- month moving average) earnings growth, which had remained at .%, much lower than earlier in the year and below the Committee s August projection. The key components had, however, been volatile. The twelve-month rate of private sector earnings growth had risen from .% in July to .% in August. Private sector services earnings growth had increased by one percentage point to .%, in part reflecting a smaller negative contribution from bonuses than in recent months. The whole economy measure of growth in regular pay (ie excluding bonuses, and not seasonally adjusted) had eased slightly from around .% in Q to a revised .% in July and .% in August; manufacturing had fallen by . percentage points to .% but private services had risen by . percentage points to .%. The twelve-month average of settlements had remained at .% in September.##NewPara##Given their month-to-month volatility, there was not much evidence in these data of accumulating labour cost pressures. Staff analysis of the  New Earnings Survey suggested that earnings growth in the year to April  was broadly in line with the Average Earnings Index figure for the same period. While the Bank s regional Agents were reporting increased concerns amongst their contacts about the coming pay round, some members pointed to the recent Pay Prospects survey produced by Industrial Relations Services, which suggested that the median settlement in the next pay round was##NewPara##expected to remain at % and that the mean pay settlement was expected to edge up only modestly from .% to .%.##NewPara##One possible explanation for the benign earnings outturns, for which there was anecdotal evidence, was that companies were not bidding up wages to attract workers, on the grounds that they did not believe that they could pass on increased costs to their customers and so could not profitably increase output; instead they were choosing not to expand output to satisfy potential demand. That might be explained by intensified competition in product markets and a more stable monetary environment. If this were the explanation, it could not be guaranteed to persist. In the view of some members, it represented suppressed inflation.##NewPara##An alternative possible explanation also placed weight on intensified competition in product markets, but emphasised that it might have reduced the rate of unemployment consistent with stable inflation. More generally, it was possible that the sustainable rate of unemployment had, for a variety of reasons, improved by more than the Committee had already allowed for in its recent forecasts. A further adjustment had been made by the Committee in the latest Inflation Report projections.##NewTopic##Prices and costs##NewPara##RPIX inflation had risen by . percentage points to .% in September. This was not accounted for entirely by petrol prices, posing the question as to whether the increase provided news about price pressures or was simply noise. However, the provisional estimate for October, which was available to the Committee for its Thursday session, was for it to drop back. Taken at face value, this did not suggest that retail price inflation was increasing. It was likely, though, that RPIX inflation would be more volatile than usual during the next few months, reflecting commodity price changes and the unusual weather conditions.##NewPara##At its October meeting the Committee had noted the rise in inflation expectations between the second and third quarters suggested by the Basix survey of the general public and trade unions. More recent data from the series would not be available until the Committee s January meeting. But it was noted that the GfK survey measure of consumer confidence, which contained some information on inflation expectations, had fallen back in October, lending support to the view that the sharp rise in surveyed inflation expectations in September was a temporary effect of the fuel crisis.##NewTopic##The November GDP growth and inflation projections##NewPara##The Committee agreed the projections to be published in the Inflation Report on Thursday  November.##NewPara##On the assumption of an official repo rate of % over the next two years, the central projection was for GDP growth to slow to around  % by early next year and to remain at about that rate. On the central projection, RPIX inflation rose gradually to around target at the two-year horizon, when it was still rising gently.##NewPara##As in previous forecasts, there was a range of views about the most likely outlook for inflation,##NewPara##but views were closer than in recent quarters. The effects of the main differences in assumptions about the supply-side performance of the economy and the outlook for earnings were presented in Table .B of the November Inflation Report.##NewPara##The Committee agreed that the uncertainty surrounding the central projections had risen since August, reflecting increased uncertainty about the world economic outlook, oil prices, the pace at which private sector demand was decelerating, and supply-side developments, including earnings growth. The balance of risks to output growth was judged to be slightly on the downside, reflecting the risks to world economic activity. The risks to inflation were broadly balanced.##NewTopic##The immediate policy decision##NewPara##Taken as a whole, the recent news confirmed the picture of a slowing economy, and was regarded as broadly consistent with both the August and the November projections. During the forecast period, output was projected to grow in line with the economy s productive capacity, and inflation was projected as most likely to lie in a narrow range around the  % target. The outlook judged most likely was, therefore, very favourable.Members agreed that the central projection was consistent with maintaining the repo rate at %.##NewPara##The outlook was, though, more uncertain than in recent quarters, and members varied in the weight they placed on particular risks around the best collective projection.##NewPara##Upside risks to inflation from the labour market were stressed by a number of members. Skill shortages were high and apparently rising. Recruitment intentions, as measured in surveys, remained strong. If they were realised, total hours worked might continue to grow at the recent rate of around .% per year. In that case, if hourly productivity were to grow in a range of, say, .% to .%, output growth in a range of   % to   % (or around  % per quarter) would be implied. In fact, the central projection was for growth to slow and for unemployment to begin rising soon, so those would be crucial indicators going forward, as would be the coming round of pay settlements. A second key upside risk to inflation was the possibility of sterling s exchange rate falling by more than assumed in the central projection. These two risks were not independent. Sterling s appreciation over the past few years had increased households  spending power and so had helped to dampen pay pressures. A depreciating exchange rate would, conversely, tend to intensify pay pressures. To the extent that productivity growth increased, that would help to offset any such pressures, but there was a risk that, as in the past, cost pressures would eventually feed through into higher prices. A third upside risk was that private sector final demand would not slow as sharply or as soon as assumed in the central projection, although it was possible that the effects on aggregate demand could be offset by a larger- than-expected negative contribution from net trade.##NewPara##On the downside, members generally thought it possible that the international outlook could prove weaker than currently expected, given tighter credit conditions, the apparent slowdown in investment in the US, and fragility amongst some emerging market economies. Domestically, some members thought that the supply-side performance of the economy might prove to be better than assumed, either because the recent earnings figures suggested that the rate of unemployment consistent with stable inflation was lower than assumed or because the recent improvement in hourly productivity growth might be sustained. Some members pointed to the possibility that GDP growth might have been increasingly understated in recent years because of the possible mis-measurement of the ICT sector. This might have had the effect, in their view, of imparting an upward bias to the inflation forecast. In addition, fiscal policy could turn out tighter than planned, given the higher-than-expected tax yield and the possibility of continued underspending by Departments. The fiscal measures on which the Government was consulting would, if and when implemented, temporarily reduce inflation. On one view, a more rapid slowdown in output growth was implied by various leading indicators and by a measure of monetary conditions that incorporated the continued effect of the rise of the exchange rate in recent years. With the economy at (or perhaps past) a turning point in the growth cycle, it was possible that the Committee s forecasts would not adequately capture any downward revisions in##NewPara##household expectations and business confidence, which sometimes occurred rather sharply at such junctures. In particular, investment, in the UK and elsewhere, could fall sharply if demand   particularly for  high-tech  products   grew less strongly than had been expected. A repo rate of % probably remained slightly contractionary. That was appropriate for the moment but the downside risks needed to be watched carefully.##NewPara##The Governor invited members to vote on the proposition that the Bank s repo rate be maintained at .%. The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the proposition.
