The world economy##NewPara##In the United States final domestic demand was still growing strongly, although GDP growth in Q had slowed to below  %, reflecting negative contributions from net trade and stockbuilding. Headline consumer price inflation was increasing, reflecting higher oil prices.##NewPara##There had been little market reaction to the tightening of US monetary policy in August, although equity prices had fallen slightly in recent weeks. While this could be consistent with a soft landing for the US economy, it need not be so, particularly if the current account deficit continued to grow as a result of strong domestic demand, or if forward-looking indicators of price pressures continued to rise. The prospects for sustainable growth would be improved if supply-side changes, such as a rise in productivity, continued to underpin the increase in output in the US, and led to inflows of capital from the rest of the world. Nevertheless risks remained of a sharp move in the dollar and/or in equity prices if these supply-side factors should tail off. At its October meeting the FOMC had left rates unchanged, but with a bias towards a possible firming of policy going forward. The Committee agreed that although there were still risks to the outlook for the US economy, it was not clear that these were any greater than they had been a month earlier.##NewPara##In Japan output had been stronger in Q than expected, although it was too soon to say whether this upturn would be sustained. A fiscal package now looked likely, and statements by the Bank of Japan had indicated that monetary policy would remain accommodative. But over the past month there had been a strong appreciation in the yen which, if sustained, could weaken future growth prospects.##NewPara##In the euro area, business confidence was now back to its long-term average, with##NewPara##Q GDP growth positive in most countries other than Germany. Orders data also pointed to a recovery. Broad money growth was above its reference value, although doubts remained##NewPara##about the quality of these data, subject as they were to revision. The recovery was still in its early stages, and had yet to become firmly established.##NewPara##Prospects in the emerging market economies were on balance little changed from a month earlier. If anything, forecasts were now a little less negative for Russia and Brazil, although not for the rest of Latin America. In many Asian countries growth was strong, if much as expected.##NewPara##While the uncertainties about the prospects for the world economy had diminished over the past few months, and recent data suggested a stronger recovery in world trade, the Committee concluded that there had been little change in the outlook since its previous meeting.##NewTopic##Money and credit##NewPara##Recent data for the monetary aggregates had been volatile, and it was unclear whether the latest figures contained much in the way of significant information. In September M was virtually unchanged from a month earlier, and as a result the annual growth rate had fallen to .% from .% in August. In August M had grown in underlying terms for the first time since April, with the annual growth rate a little higher at .%. The growth in August primarily reflected movements in the deposits of Other Financial Corporations; deposits by Private Non-Financial Corporations had fallen.##NewPara##Household credit growth in the year to August, and estimates of mortgage equity withdrawal in real terms in Q, were both at their highest levels since  Q, although the latter had been revised down slightly. While it was too soon to draw conclusions from the various house price indices, there was now some suggestion that the hype surrounding the housing market had moderated.##NewPara##Nominal interest rates implied by futures contracts for the next nine months were some  basis points higher than a month earlier, with rates higher across most of the yield curve, although at around two years the implied rates were little changed. Towards the end of September these rates had been lower than at the time of the Committee s previous meeting, but there was little sign yet that by moving in September the Committee had achieved any##NewPara##lasting reduction in interest rate expectations further along the yield curve. On a longer-term basis, two-year real interest rates, calculated using survey-based measures of inflation expectations, had risen by - basis points over the past quarter. Swap rates for maturities of three years or more were generally - basis points higher over the month as a whole, with gilt yields up by rather more. Equity indices had fallen by around % over the month, and the sterling effective exchange rate had appreciated by %. The magnitude of the rise in medium-term interest rates and the exchange rate over the month as a whole was higher than might normally be expected from a rise in the repo rate of  basis points. This might have reflected market perceptions of a turning point in interest rates, and it was possible that there had also been other influences, for example higher European interest rates and M&A-related activity in the exchange markets. Whatever the cause, these movements over the past month would tend to restrain demand.##NewTopic##Demand and output##NewPara##Real quarterly GDP growth was now stronger than earlier estimated, at .% in Q and .% in Q, and on a year-on-year basis had picked up from its low point of .% in Q.##NewPara##Manufacturing output had increased by .% both in July and August, and the##NewPara##National Institute for Economic and Social Research now projected GDP growth of .% in Q.##NewPara##During the past month, household expenditure had been revised up in Q, in part due to new estimates for expenditure on cars. But with the level of household expenditure little changed in Q, the quarterly growth rate had been revised down to .%. Business investment had been revised up to .% in Q, though government investment had fallen by %. Final domestic demand therefore continued to grow strongly, although by less than in the previous quarter. Domestic demand itself was much less buoyant, reflecting a sharp fall in inventories, especially in manufacturing. The difference between growth in final domestic demand in Q (at .% on a year earlier) and GDP (at .%) had been the highest since the first quarter of .##NewPara##Although the current account deficit had widened in Q, in volume terms the net trade contribution to quarterly GDP growth had been positive. While these were volatile numbers, the most recent trade data suggested that the stronger export performance in Q might have##NewPara##continued into the third quarter, on account of stronger world trade. Manufacturing export orders, as measured by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS), had also risen in Q and many of the contacts of the Bank s regional Agents had reported some recovery in overseas orders. A strengthening in exports relative to domestic demand would lead to a better-balanced recovery.##NewPara##Indications for domestic demand in Q remained strong, judging by the retail sales data, the CBI Distributive Trades Survey, and reports from the Bank s regional Agents, but the GfK consumer confidence measure had fallen back in September and the CIPS services survey, while remaining well above , was also slightly lower. Measures of industrial confidence about profitability had strengthened, although the effects of the recent appreciation of sterling were unlikely to have fed through to survey data yet. Car registration data and evidence from the Bank s regional Agents suggested that activity in this sector may have slowed in Q, although the data were still hard to interpret given the changes in the registration cycle for new vehicles and survey evidence was mixed. Tax revenues appeared to be buoyant, perhaps largely reflecting cyclical factors.##NewPara##Taken together, the evidence suggested slightly stronger output growth than had been expected the previous month, and perhaps a rather stronger export performance. Some Committee members saw a few signs that domestic demand growth could perhaps be moderating, as it would need to do at some point if growth were to prove sustainable, although a period of above-trend growth was to be expected in the recovery phase of the cycle.##NewTopic##Labour market##NewPara##Employment growth was no longer slowing, with an increase of more than , on the latest three month Labour Force Survey (LFS) measure, and around , in Q on the more volatile Workforce jobs measure. The LFS unemployment rate continued to fall, reaching .% in the three months to July, and the claimant count rate was down to .%.##NewPara##Measures of labour market inactivity had meanwhile risen.##NewPara##The Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services reported that shortages of temporary and permanent staff persisted in September, and the Bank s regional Agents spoke##NewPara##of a similar picture in most parts of the UK. So far as skill shortages were concerned, it was important to distinguish between cyclical effects and structural issues relating to education and training. It was also possible that skill shortages might now lead to less generalised pressure on earnings than in the past, given the increasing importance of individually-tailored contracts. But some of the Agents  contacts reported labour shortages even for unskilled jobs.##NewPara##These skill shortages did not yet appear to be influencing pay settlements, which continued to fall. The recently announced electricians  settlement was a possible exception, but it appeared to have consolidated certain existing supplementary payments so that the net settlement might have been rather less than had been reported. Earnings growth, as measured by the Average Earnings Index, had meanwhile fallen to .% in the year to July, from .% in the previous month. The headline rate, a less volatile measure calculated as a three-month moving average, had risen slightly to .%.##NewPara##Real earnings growth had increased, and might suggest that pressures in the labour market were greater than implied by the path of nominal earnings. But it might be that employers and employees had expected rather higher inflation when settlements were agreed, and to that extent had been surprised by the subsequent growth in real earnings. How that would influence next spring s pay bargaining round remained to be seen.##NewTopic##Prices and costs##NewPara##Input prices for manufacturing were rising, as a result of higher oil prices, and were .% up on a year earlier. However, output prices (excluding excise duties) were little changed.##NewPara##Despite higher oil prices, RPIX inflation in the year to August had been a little lower than expected, at .%, in part due to lower food prices. Within this total, goods price inflation was very low, and had turned negative on some measures, such as the retail sales deflator, while the prices of services continued to increase. The implied deflator for GDP at market prices had been revised, with the annual rate of change at .% in Q. Most measures of domestically generated inflation were falling, with the RPIX-based measure down to .% in Q on a year earlier, compared with almost % only six months earlier.##NewPara##It was possible that increasing competition in the retail sector, for instance in food and clothing, might reduce RPIX inflation further below target, at least in the short term. But it was difficult to be sure how large any such effect might be. Some types of price cut (such as   for   offers) were not captured by the RPIX. Others might be offset by increases in prices elsewhere, although the scope to do so would be limited if competition was indeed more intense, or if low and stable inflation made it easier for consumers to identify and react to relative price changes. A survey by the Bank s regional Agents had shown widespread discounting driven by new and existing competition, and consumer resistance to price rises. Regulatory decisions (for example on utilities pricing) and rulings by competition authorities might add to the downwards pressure on inflation, although not all these factors were new: deregulation and competition had been important influences on pricing for many years, although more sectors currently might perhaps be affected than in recent years.##NewPara##Even if competition were important in restraining price increases in the near term, what would be the effect on inflation further out? To the extent that lower prices fed through into inflation expectations and wage bargaining negotiations next spring, the effects might persist beyond the short run. But to the extent that some of the reductions in prices were time- limited (and perhaps analogous to advertising) there could be a bounceback in inflation further ahead as they unwound. A further factor which might prolong downward pressure on prices was e-commerce. Both the short-run and longer-run effects of these various factors would need to be considered carefully in the context of the forthcoming Inflation Report forecast.##NewPara##The Committee discussed the recent doubling in oil prices. In the short term, these increases would push up inflation, albeit from a position below target. The Committee had to set policy so that prospective inflation further ahead was on target, so it would be important not to accommodate the longer-run effects from higher oil prices.##NewTopic##The immediate policy decision##NewPara##The Committee discussed various arguments for leaving the repo rate unchanged at .%.##NewPara##Final domestic demand was still growing rapidly, and was beginning to be reflected in stronger output growth; growth in Q might be clearly above trend for the first time in two years, and output had been revised up for both Q and Q. There were signs   not least in survey data   that world trade in general, and UK exports in particular, might be recovering. With stronger input prices and a tight labour market, there were upside risks to inflation in the medium term, although if the economy had fallen below potential after a period of below- trend growth, a period of above-trend growth would be consistent with the inflation target.##NewPara##More immediately, there was a possibility that increased competition would result in greater downwards pressure on margins and prices, at least in the short term.##NewPara##Until recently, falling import prices had helped to restrain inflation, while output had been held back by a negative contribution from net trade. Both of these influences might now be coming to an end, although much would depend on the future path of the exchange rate. If domestic demand growth and domestically generated inflation fell back as net trade and import prices picked up, the economy should be better balanced going forward. If not, pressure on resources   and inflationary pressures more generally   would increase.##NewPara##The increase in the Bank s repo rate at the Committee s previous meeting had surprised the markets. Compared with a month earlier, market interest rates were higher at most maturities, as were rates on fixed-rate mortgages, while sterling was stronger and equity prices lower. While these developments might in part reflect influences other than the increase in official rates, if maintained they would help to restrain demand growth and inflation in the medium term.##NewPara##There remained a number of puzzles, with most output and demand figures continuing to be stronger than expected, while inflation was if anything lower. Similarly, in the labour market, despite a continuing fall in unemployment and reports of growing labour shortages there was as yet little sign of an acceleration in nominal earnings, although unit labour cost estimates were increasing quite rapidly. The increase in real earnings growth might signal labour market pressures, but it could instead reflect lower than expected inflation. It was unclear how long this combination of stronger growth with lower inflation would last; it might reflect domestic developments, such as structural changes in product and labour markets, or alternatively external influences, which could prove temporary. The change in market rates since the Committee s previous meeting in September meant there was no need##NewPara##to move official rates now, although the Committee would remain alert to any signs that robust growth was feeding through into pressure on prices.##NewPara##Some members of the Committee emphasised the likelihood that inflation, particularly in the short run, would fall further below target, in part reflecting the competitive pressures in retailing and regulatory developments in the utilities sector. Nearly all inflation measures were at present falling; RPIX had been below target for five months, and excluding petrol prices was running at only .%. Given the structural changes that may have occurred in the labour and product markets, it made sense to see whether higher growth would translate into as much of a rise in inflation as was suggested by historical relationships. The rise in the repo rate had contributed to a significant tightening across the yield curve, and the impact of a stronger exchange rate had yet to be seen, even in survey data.##NewPara##The Governor invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank s repo rate be maintained at .%. The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the proposition.
