It is a very great honour for me   as a graduate from that other place   to have been invited to open officially this splendid new home of Oxford economics. It s a great honour but also a real pleasure. ###newline### The first is that it gives me the opportunity to say a long overdue thank-you to the University   and to the Economics Faculty in particular   for the huge contribution that you have made not just to the study of economics in this country but more specifically to the development of our own professional capacity at the Bank of England for economic analysis and policy-making. ###newline### Economics has increasingly become the working language of large parts of the Bank. [You only have to come through the front door these days to hear people discussing their co-integration with the model they d met the night before.] We employ nearly 250 people with some form of economics degree   getting on for half our total staff in the analyst/manager grades   and 10% of them studied in Oxford. In the past 3 years 20% of our first degree economists have come from Oxford. But, more than that, 5 of our present 9 Monetary Policy Committee members are clearly identifiable Oxonians, and another 2 were taught away from Oxford by Professor Hendry! ###newline### So we do owe you a great deal   it means, of course, that people will know where the blame lies if we get things terribly wrong. ###newline### Now there will be those who complain that the extent of Oxford s connection with the Bank reflects sample selection bias. But the fact is we simply cannot afford bias or discrimination. In today s world if you want the best results you have to ###newline### go for the best people you can find wherever they come from. That explains why our economists have studied at 55 different universities, indeed why about 50 of our economists are non-British nationals from about 15 foreign countries. ###newline### And that brings me to the second reason why I m so pleased to be here   which is, like Oliver Twist, to ask for more! Subsidiarity has its place in a different ###newline### context. But I would suppose there is a non-zero probability that Oxford economics will benefit significantly over time from the centralisation which created ###newline### the Economics Department in 1999, and its physical concentration into this new building. It s often said that if you laid all the world s economists end to end they d never reach a conclusion. I d rather think that if you put all Oxford s more than 1500 economists together the result will be a profusion   of insights and ideas ###newline### of research and debate, and hence of talent, from which the global and national economies, Oxford, and we too at the Bank will benefit far into the future. ###newline### Vice Chancellor, you said a moment ago that economics lies somewhere between a science and an art   and I very much agree. In fact perhaps what I most appreciate ###newline### in all the people who have been appointed to the MPC since it began life 4 years ago, and the Bank staff who support them, is their ability to inform their art with highly sophisticated science, but nevertheless to remain aware of where the science stops and the art takes over. It is that which makes our work such fun. ###newline### I am cautiously optimistic   to use the central banker s euphemism for  totally convinced    that both the science and the art of Oxford economics will flourish in its new surroundings, and it gives me enormous pleasure to declare your new building [-and not just its windows] officially open.
