Demand and output##NewPara##The Committee began by considering the most recent National Accounts data, and the strength of many of the indicators relating to consumption.##NewPara##The National Accounts estimates for  Q showed quarterly real GDP growth at .%, up from .% in the earlier release, and slightly higher than in  Q. By contrast, estimates of growth in final domestic demand had been revised down to zero, from .% previously. These data were difficult to interpret. All of the .% increase in domestic demand in Q was now attributed to stockbuilding (which included a positive alignment adjustment, an adjustment made to inventories to help balance the National Accounts). The other major revision was to whole-economy investment, which was estimated to have fallen by .% in Q, rather than rising by .% as in the previous release. Within this total, business investment, and more particularly services sector investment, had fallen sharply. As expected, given the slowdown in the world economy, net trade had made a negative contribution to GDP growth in Q, but government consumption in real terms had grown rather faster than previously thought.##NewPara##It was puzzling that household consumption growth had not shown more of a rebound; at .%, it was estimated to have grown no faster in Q than in the previous quarter, when it had been affected by bad weather and transport-related disruptions. Other indicators suggested a more buoyant picture for consumer spending, which had continued into the second quarter. Retail sales volumes had been growing very rapidly, at around  % at a quarterly rate since the turn of the year, and by .% in the year to May. Such growth was much more rapid than the equivalent figures for household consumption of retail goods in the Q National Accounts. The latter figures might be revised (perhaps with a corresponding reduction in the alignment adjustment), although it was noted that even if the estimate for consumption growth were doubled to .%, final domestic demand growth in Q would be only half the rate assumed in the May Inflation Report. Even if the figures##NewPara##were not revised, such a disparity in growth rates was unlikely to persist for long. The strength in retail sales appeared to be consistent with rising consumer confidence (with the GfK measure in June at its highest since January ) and with the money, credit and housing market data. However, some of the strength might have reflected a shift in spending out of sectors such as leisure services, which had been affected by the foot and mouth outbreak. New private car registrations had risen by over % in the year to May, though this represented a slower rate of growth than earlier in the year.##NewPara##The housing market appeared distinctly strong. The Nationwide and Halifax house price indices were both increasing by around  % on a year earlier, which seemed consistent with the data from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors on the balance of estate agents reporting rises in house prices. If anything, house prices had accelerated recently, and mortgage approvals had risen further. The strength of house prices was both a symptom and a cause of robust consumer confidence. It would partly offset the fall in financial wealth resulting from movements in equity prices, which had declined by just over % since the Committee s June meeting.##NewPara##Survey evidence was mixed. The index of business activity in services produced by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) had increased only slightly in June, and was still well below its average level for the preceding two years, despite an easing of the effects from the foot and mouth outbreak. The index for manufacturing, however, had risen a little (while remaining below the  no change   level) and that for construction had strengthened further. The Engineering Employers  Federation survey showed a significant weakening of output and new orders in the sector.##NewPara##Would consumption growth soon start to slow, as had been forecast in the May Inflation Report, in part because of a deceleration in financial wealth? In one sense it already had: in the##NewPara##National Accounts for the past two quarters it had been steady at only .% a quarter. But many of the consumption-related indicators remained strong, and it was not clear what would cause this underlying strength to diminish. Household debt-income ratios were at record levels, but the costs of servicing the debt in nominal terms, as measured by income gearing levels, were not unusually high. Consumer confidence might fall back if unemployment began to rise, but to date unemployment had continued to decline. The strength of house prices provided ample collateral against which consumers could borrow, often at very competitive rates. Increases in wealth had helped in the past##NewPara##to support consumption, which over the past four years had tended to grow faster than real incomes, with the saving ratio falling to just over % in Q.##NewPara##Over and above the temporary effects associated with the foot and mouth outbreak, there were underlying imbalances within the economy and these could not continue to widen indefinitely. Over the past five years, private final domestic demand had grown by around  % a year. Such growth could not continue in the long run, at least on the basis of present estimates of likely growth in productive potential. To date, the counterpart had been a steady deterioration in the net trade position, although the worsening in trade volumes had to some extent been masked by changes in the terms of trade.##NewPara##In general, the strongest areas of the economy were those least affected by competition from overseas, while the weakest were those exposed to the downturn in the world economy, and to the weakness of the euro against sterling. The Index of Production data for May, available to the Committee at its meeting, showed manufacturing again declining by more than had been expected. The electrical and optical equipment sector showed another sharp fall, reflecting the global downturn in the information and communications technology (ICT) sector, although this did not account for all of the reduction in manufacturing output.##NewPara##Profitability data illustrated this dichotomy well. In  Q, the net rate of return on capital in services had been close to %, while that in manufacturing had fallen below %, from almost % in .  More generally, the drag on GDP growth from net trade helped to explain why the  indicators relating to the corporate sector tended to be weaker than those relating to consumption. This divergence seemed particularly marked at present. It was possible that the strength of consumption might in the future feed through more fully into domestic production. Alternatively, pressures on businesses might lead to cutbacks in employment, which would then act as a brake on consumption growth, not least through the effects on consumer confidence.##NewPara##The trade deficit on goods and services might be sustainable at current levels, at around % of GDP. But were the deficit to go on increasing, a fall in the exchange rate would become more likely. Moreover, the exchange rate might fall for other reasons, for instance a recovery in the euro. The implications of a fall in the exchange rate for the economy and for policy would depend on the  reasons for that fall, and on the context.##NewTopic##Money and credit##NewPara##Annual growth in broad money and credit had eased in May, reflecting slower growth in both measures for private non-financial corporations. Growth in notes and coin remained high by the standards of the past decade, but had not risen any further despite an acceleration in retail sales values.##NewPara##Lending to households remained buoyant, growing by .% in the year to May, and household M growth had picked up to .%, its highest rate for nearly ten years. In part this reflected the weakness of retail unit trust sales and other inflows into equities, with some of these funds being held on deposit instead. Nevertheless, the increase in household money growth was consistent with continued robust retail spending growth. Loan approvals for house purchases had risen to their highest level since  (when there had been a break in the statistical series) and growth in secured borrowing had also increased recently. All of this helped to buttress the present strength of the housing market, and of consumption more generally.##NewPara##Interest rate expectations implied by short sterling futures had risen by up to  basis points since the Committee s previous meeting. This increase seemed to have been triggered by the unexpectedly strong RPIX data for May, even though much of that rise had resulted from increases in the prices of seasonal food and petrol, both of which might prove to be temporary.##NewPara##While the RPIX data might have been the catalyst for this movement, particularly at short maturities, the increase in market rates had subsequently been underpinned by the strength of retail sales, and by the consumer confidence and housing market data. It was also possible that the dip in sterling early in the month had made the market more aware of the downside risks attached to the currency, even though the fall, which seemed to have been associated with speculation about early UK entry into economic and monetary union, had proved temporary.##NewPara##While the move up in futures rates may have been exaggerated, there now seemed much less expectation in the market of a reduction in the repo rate to % or below. A poll of economists by Reuters on - June had put the probability of no change in the repo rate at the Committee s July meeting at nearly %, with divided views about the path of interest rates thereafter. The rise in##NewPara##market rates was also beginning to feed through into the rest of the economy, with some lenders increasing their two-year fixed mortgage rates during the past month.##NewPara##The Committee agreed that while market rates were not necessarily a good predictor of the future path of official interest rates, there had clearly been a shift in the market s perception of UK economic prospects over the past month.  To the extent that this persisted, and falls in the Bank s repo rate were no longer discounted in market prices, it represented a de facto tightening in monetary conditions relative to the position a month earlier.##NewTopic##The world economy##NewPara##Prospects in the United States seemed if anything a little brighter than a month ago.  GDP  growth in the first half of  seemed to be running at around % at an annual rate, and the most likely outcome was for growth to pick up moderately over the remainder of this year and into , though some members thought that growth in the first half of  might be weaker. The Committee agreed that there were still significant risks, not least if there were to be a major downward revision to views of the sustainable medium-term growth rate of US productivity.##NewPara##Consumer spending in the United States had so far proved resilient, with real consumption increasing by .% both in April and May, while retail sales were little changed in May, after strong growth in April. Spending on autos had remained fairly robust, as had the housing market. The Conference Board measure of consumer confidence had also risen a little in June. But the overall business sector stock-to-sales ratio was increasing, despite falls in inventories, and the ICT investment overhang persisted, with sharp falls in capacity utilisation in that sector. Nevertheless, there were some signs that the falls in manufacturing output might soon begin to moderate. In particular, the National Association of Purchasing Managers  index had risen by   points in June to ., its highest level since November, although it remained well below the neutral  level. In addition, the  basis point reduction in US  interest rates had yet to feed through fully into  spending, and nor had the tax rebate, which would be distributed in Q. But while non-defence capital goods orders had risen slightly in May, there had been a sharp fall in the imports of capital goods in April, which served to underline the global effects on this sector of the US downturn.##NewPara##The outlook for the Japanese economy continued to be gloomy, although the deterioration in business prospects as measured by the Tankan survey had been a little less than expected by the market. GDP in Q had fallen, with private investment and exports especially weak. Since then, industrial production had declined by .% in May, and by over % over the past year.##NewPara##In the euro area, annual HICP inflation in May had risen to .%, with the core measure edging up to over %. Meanwhile domestic demand in Q had been weak, with industrial and consumer confidence measures falling steadily during Q. This slowdown would tend to result in higher fiscal deficits than otherwise, provided the automatic stabilisers were allowed to operate to cushion the effects on demand.##NewPara##In Germany, industrial orders, particularly for capital goods, were sharply lower in April, and the IFO index of business confidence had fallen in May to its lowest level for two years. Consumption too was weak, with little sign of any boost from the tax cuts earlier in the year. Weak domestic demand in Germany had been a feature for some time, but there were also now signs of a weakening in domestic demand growth in France, which until recently had been relatively strong. All in all, near-term prospects in the euro area seemed weaker than previously.##NewPara##It was clear that the slowdown in the euro area was not merely a reflection of a weaker world economy: net trade in Q had been a major contributor to GDP growth there, although this was due to a sharp fall in import volumes. The weakness of the euro was a complicating factor: it would tend to boost net trade volumes, while reducing the growth in real disposable incomes, and thus perhaps consumption growth. While an upturn in the United States would of itself help to sustain activity in the euro area, both directly and via confidence effects, there were also domestic factors behind the slowdown, particularly in Germany. Moreover, were the euro area to slow while growth recovered in the United States, this would tend to exacerbate the internatio nal imbalance.##NewTopic##The UK labour market##NewPara##The Committee discussed whether the labour market had reached a turning point, or was instead continuing to tighten, and how far the present tightness was feeding through into pressures on pay.##NewPara##Employment growth, as measured by the Labour Force Survey (LFS), had slowed in the three months to April compared with the previous three months, and was now broadly in line with the increase in the population of working age. This had followed a period of more rapid employment growth, after the disruptions of the previous autumn. Average hours worked had also fallen, but this decline might be erratic. The corresponding figures for LFS unemployment showed a decline of ,, similar in size to the increase in those not active in the labour market. The claimant-count unemployment measure had continued to fall in May.##NewPara##Looking forward, the CIPS employment index had fallen to only a little above the  no change  level of  in Q, and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation survey suggested that the availability of staff had improved for the first time in two years. But while reports from the Bank s regional Agents suggested that the labour market, though tight, was no longer tightening any further, the number of vacancies reported to job centres in May had reached its highest level since the series was first published in . It was therefore not at all clear that the labour market had yet reached a turning point.##NewPara##Growth in the headline Average Earnings Index (AEI) had risen from .% in March to .% in April. The annual growth rate of regular pay (ie, earnings less bonuses but including overtime) had risen sharply, from .% in March to .% in April. Much of this reflected increases in the public sector, notably the backdating of threshold payments to teachers joining a new salary structure. In the private sector, regular pay had risen by .% in the year to April, little different from its average over the past three years. More generally, the AEI had been volatile in recent months, partly because of  echo effects  as payments related to the millennium date change dropped out of the annual comparison.##NewPara##Settlements continued to average between % and  %, although if RPI inflation moderated more slowly than had earlier seemed likely this could reduce the downwards pressure on pay in the future. While the Agents had reported some easing in skill shortages, their contacts had also noted a few signs of increasing earnings pressure. Such an increase would be consistent with other signs that underlying regular pay growth had recently edged up.##NewTopic##Prices and costs##NewPara##RPIX inflation had risen from .% in April to .% in May. This increase largely reflected sharp rises in the prices of seasonal foods and petrol. But some of the increase in inflation since January was more broadly based, although much was explained by increases in food prices. Some of the other price measures had also increased sharply, with RPIY and HICP inflation both up by##NewPara##. percentage points in May, to .% and .% respectively. It was noted that a##NewPara## persistence-weighted  measure of RPIX inflation had also risen, although it was still at a relatively low level (.%).##NewPara##Part of this increase in inflation appeared to be temporary. Oil prices had fallen from around##NewPara##$ per barrel to under $ over the past month, and world gasoline prices had fallen relative to oil prices. The earlier strength of oil prices had been surprising; the recent reduction seemed more consistent with the much slower pace of world economic activity during . While seasonal food prices might remain high for some months to come, these were likely to return to more normal levels by next year.  There was also little sign that the increase in inflation had fed through into    expectations of inflation further forward.##NewPara##The Committee agreed that it would be wrong to read too much into one month s figures, and that RPIX inflation was likely to continue to fluctuate in the months ahead. There was in any case little the Committee could or should do to affect inflation over the very short term.##NewPara##Surveys of retail prices had risen, consistent with the recent increase in RPIX inflation. But earlier in the supply chain, manufacturing input and output price inflation had fallen, as had the equivalent CIPS indices. Similarly, in the services sector the CIPS surveys of average prices charged and average input prices had both continued to fall, to their lowest levels since .##NewTopic##The immediate policy decision##NewPara##Members agreed that while there had been a considerable amount of news during the month, on balance it had not greatly altered their views on the appropriate setting of policy, although for some the news made it rather less likely that the next movement in interest rates would be down.##NewPara##The Committee agreed that the prospects for the world economy were mixed. There had been some more promising news from the United States, in the sense that activity seemed to be holding up rather better than might have been feared. But the economic outlook for Japan and the euro area seemed worse than a month ago. With sterling remaining rather stronger than projected in the May Inflation Report, and given the importance of the euro area to UK exporters, the prospects for net trade had deteriorated. Partly for this reason, manufacturing production had weakened in recent months; the CIPS services survey was also not as strong as might have been expected. The National Accounts data showed a sharp rise in stockbuilding in Q, with investment declining steeply, although both might prove to be erratic. But many of the other domestic indicators were robust: retail sales (although not the Q consumption figures), household credit, the housing market and consumer confidence. There was also little sign that the labour market was yet on the turn, although some forward-looking indicators continued to suggest that it might be soon. There were few indications of any marked increase in settlements, although regular pay growth had edged up over the past month. Much of the recent increase in RPIX inflation reflected temporary factors, such as seasonal food prices, and oil prices had begun to fall back. There were, however, some signs of a more broadly based increase in inflation since the start of the year, although forward-looking surveys suggested that this might not persist.##NewPara##Against this background, most members of the Committee felt that the repo rate should not be changed this month. While it was important not to overinterpret some of the rather erratic recent data, on balance the information appeared to point to robust growth in consumption, combined with continuing pressure on the internationally exposed sectors, a buoyant labour market, and rather higher inflation in the short term than had earlier seemed likely. The strength of consumption seemed broadly based, with little sign of any faltering. While interest rates in the United Kingdom were higher in real terms than in some other countries, this probably reflected differences in national savings and investment patterns; there was no compelling evidence that the present level of interest rates was inappropriate. The dichotomy between the internationally exposed and more sheltered sectors continued, but while this heightened the risks at some point of an adjustment downwards in the exchange rate, differing views were expressed about the implications of this for policy. For some, the risk that the exchange rate was more likely to fall than to rise further in itself affected the inflation outlook, and so should enter the considerations for the setting of interest rates. Others questioned how far policy should seek to anticipate a fall in the exchange rate.##NewPara##In any case, the news on the month suggested that there was no need to move rates. Instead the Committee should monitor the situation, being prepared to adjust rates in either direction in the light of new information. To the extent that market rates no longer discounted a further reduction in the repo rate, there had been a slight tightening in monetary conditions, which to some members was not unwelcome. For these reasons, the repo rate should remain at  % this month.##NewPara##On another view, it would have been right to reduce the repo rate to % at the Committee s previous meeting, and nothing had changed since then to alter this view. The news had been mixed, both on the world economy (where the US outlook remained unclear and where prospects elsewhere had weakened) and domestically. Equity prices had fallen back, suggesting some weakening in confidence about the outlook. The Q National Accounts data suggested that destocking represented a significant risk to the near-term outlook, and investment was weakening. Final domestic demand in Q was well below the central projection in the May Inflation Report, and it was likely that GDP growth in Q would be no higher than .% for the third quarter in a row. While the housing market and retail sales remained strong, there were few signs of increasing pressures, either in the labour market or on prices, from forward-looking data. RPIX inflation had been higher than expected in May, but this reflected temporary effects which were unlikely to persist into next year, and it was notable that the global energy and food price shocks had been sufficient only to bring inflation back up to target, with UK inflation well below headline inflation in many other countries. The recent fall in the prices of oil and metals, and global competitive pressures, reflecting excess capacity in the world economy, would restrain UK inflation. Turning to the issue of imbalances and any associated exchange rate risk, if the short-term interest rate was held higher now because of an expected depreciation of the exchange rate, this might lead sterling to be stronger than it might otherwise be. Domestically, output recently had been growing below trend, reducing the pressure on productive potential. For these reasons, a reduction of  basis points in the repo rate to % was needed to meet the inflation target.##NewPara##The Governor invited members to vote on the proposition that the Bank s repo rate should be maintained at .%. Eight members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King,##NewPara##David Clementi, Christopher Allsopp, Kate Barker, Charles Bean, Stephen Nickell and##NewPara##Ian Plenderleith) voted for the proposition. Sushil Wadhwani voted against, preferring a reduction in the repo rate of  basis points.
